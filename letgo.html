    <h1>When God Lets Go: A Lesson from Prince Dutch</h1>

    <p>The Imperial Chief Guard watched in horror as Prince Dutch’s head disappeared beneath the fierce torrents of River Hinze. In that heart-wrenching moment, the guard had only managed to save three of the emperor’s sons. The crown prince was gone—swept away by the force of his own defiance.</p>

    <h2>A Forbidden Venture</h2>

    <p>Earlier that day, the emperor had sternly warned his sons not to play downstream near the danger zone. To ensure their safety, the Imperial Guard tied their surfing boat securely onshore, ready to pull them back at any sign of danger. But Prince Dutch, driven by thrill and rebellion, slyly untied the restraining rope and ventured into the forbidden zone.</p>

    <p>The water’s speed thrilled him. The warnings of the guard were ignored. And when the current pulled hard, the guard had no choice but to release the rope—and with it, the disobedient prince—into the roaring depths.</p>

      “Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves.”

    </blockquote>

    <h2>When the Spirit Is Withdrawn</h2>

    <p>This sobering story reflects a deeper spiritual truth. What happens when we continually ignore the warnings of the Holy Spirit? What happens when we deliberately resist God’s pleadings? The Bible warns that persistent resistance to God can lead to a point where <strong>His Spirit no longer strives</strong> with man (Genesis 6:3). Like the prince, the soul that refuses to heed God's voice is in danger of being left to perish in the flood of their own desires.</p>

      “Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.”  
      <span class="ref">—Hosea 4:17</span>

    <blockquote class="quote-sop">
      “By continual resistance the sinner places himself where he knows nothing but resistance… the dread mark is placed over his doorway, ‘Ephraim is joined to his idols; let him alone.’”  
      <span class="ref">—Letter 51a, 1895 | 4BC 1174.5</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>A Time of No Return</h2>

    <p>The prophet describes a terrifying global moment soon to come:</p>

    <blockquote class="quote-sop">
      “When He leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the inhabitants of the earth… The restraint which has been upon the wicked is removed, and Satan has entire control of the finally impenitent. God's long-suffering has ended. The world has rejected His mercy, despised His love, and trampled upon His law… Unsheltered by divine grace, they have no protection from the wicked one.”  
      <span class="ref">—The Great Controversy, p. 614.1</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Don't Be Like Prince Dutch</h2>

    <p>Dear reader, don’t risk the unpardonable sin. Don’t wait until God lets go of the rope. His Spirit is striving with your heart even now. His mercy pleads with you. Respond while the door is still open. <strong>He longs to save, not to let go.</strong></p>

    <blockquote class="quote-bible">
      “Today, if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts.”  
      <span class="ref">—Hebrews 3:15</span>
