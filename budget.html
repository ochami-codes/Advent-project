      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Budgeting is more than a financial practice—it's a spiritual discipline. While the Bible doesn’t use the term “budget,” it teaches principles of stewardship, planning, and faithfulness that apply directly to managing our finances for God's glory.</p>

      <h2>1. God Owns Everything</h2>
      <p>Recognizing God's ownership is the first step to biblical budgeting. We are not owners, but stewards.</p>
      <blockquote class="bible-quote">
        "The earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein." — Psalm 24:1
      </blockquote>

      <h2>2. Count the Cost</h2>
      <p>Budgeting is about planning and foresight. Jesus illustrated this principle in a practical way:</p>
      <blockquote class="bible-quote">
        "For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?" — Luke 14:28
      </blockquote>

      <h2>3. Avoid Debt and Save for Lean Times</h2>
      <p>The Bible warns about the dangers of debt and promotes wise preparation.</p>
      <blockquote class="bible-quote">
        "The borrower is servant to the lender." — Proverbs 22:7
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="bible-quote">
        "And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine." — Genesis 41:36
      </blockquote>

      <h2>4. Faithful Stewardship Is a Spiritual Duty</h2>
      <p>Good stewardship honors God and blesses others. Ellen G. White wrote:</p>
      <blockquote class="sop-quote">
        "All should learn how to keep accounts. Some neglect this work as nonessential; but this is wrong. All expenses should be accurately stated." — <i>Counsels on Stewardship</i>, p. 294
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="sop-quote">
        "Money is not ours; houses and grounds, pictures and furniture, are not ours. They are the Lord’s, and should be used to glorify His name." — <i>Testimonies for the Church</i>, Vol. 5, p. 154
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Budgeting is a powerful tool for spiritual growth and financial freedom. It reflects our loyalty to God, enables us to avoid unnecessary debt, and helps us prioritize heavenly investments. Let us take seriously the call to manage God's resources wisely, with diligence and prayer.</p>
