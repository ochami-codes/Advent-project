      <h2>The Power of Morning Prayer</h2>

      <p>The dawn of a new day is a sacred moment. It is a fresh start, a divine gift from God, and a precious opportunity to align our hearts with His will. Morning prayer is not just a tradition; it is a lifeline that connects us to the strength, wisdom, and peace we need to navigate the day ahead. Those who begin their day with God walk in power, purpose, and protection.</p>

      <div class="quote-bible"> 
        📖 “My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.” — Psalm 5:3
      </div>

      <p>When we pray in the morning, we acknowledge our dependence on God. We confess that we cannot face the day's responsibilities, temptations, or burdens in our own strength. Morning prayer sets the tone for a God-centered life, offering us clarity in confusion and courage in trials. It is the secret place where spiritual battles are won before the day even begins.</p>

      <div class="quote-sop"> 
        📚 “Consecrate yourself to God in the morning; make this your very first work. Let your prayer be, ‘Take me, O Lord, as wholly Thine. I lay all my plans at Thy feet.’” — *Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 70*
      </div>

      <p>Jesus Himself practiced morning prayer. Often, He would rise long before sunrise to commune with the Father. If the sinless Son of God needed early communion with heaven, how much more should we? Morning prayer places our day under God’s control, offering peace amidst the noise and direction amidst uncertainty.</p>

      <div class="quote-bible"> 
        📖 “And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.” — Mark 1:35
      </div>

      <p>Morning prayer is also a shield. As we surrender our hearts to Christ each morning, angels are commissioned to walk with us, and the Holy Spirit fills our minds with heaven’s presence. It is during these sacred moments that we receive divine appointments, insights, and the spiritual armor we need for the day’s battle.</p>

      <div class="quote-sop"> 
        📚 “If we would but listen, angels would tell us what to do. They would guide our feet. But the reason we do not more often receive help is that we do not ask.” — *Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 363*
      </div>

      <p>Let morning prayer be more than routine—let it be your revival. Let it be the time where you give your heart afresh to Jesus, seek His Spirit, and claim His promises. Those who start their day on their knees will rise with strength, walk with assurance, and live with purpose. Morning prayer is the key to spiritual success.</p>
