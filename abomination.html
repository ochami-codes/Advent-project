      <h2>When Prayers Become an Abomination: A Call to True Repentance</h2>

      <p>Have you ever wondered why your prayers seem to go unanswered? Could it be that they are not a sweet-smelling incense before God—but an <strong>abomination</strong>?</p>

      <div class="quote-bible">
        He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination. — Proverbs 28:9
      </div>

      <p>This is a sobering reality. When we willfully ignore God’s law and persist in sin without repentance, even our most sincere prayers are rejected by Heaven.</p>

      <div class="quote-bible">
        If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me. — Psalm 66:18
      </div>

      <div class="quote-bible">
        Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshiper of God, and doeth His will, him He heareth. — John 9:31
      </div>

      <h3>But Aren’t We All Sinners?</h3>
      <p>Yes, we are. <em>“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”</em> — Romans 3:23</p>

      <div class="quote-sop">
        The incense, ascending with the prayers of Israel, represents the merits and intercession of Christ, His perfect righteousness, which through faith is imputed to His people. — Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 353
      </div>

      <p>Without Christ, our prayers cannot be accepted. But through Him, they ascend as a sweet-smelling savor before God.</p>

      <h3>So What Must We Do?</h3>
      <p>We must confess, repent, and turn away from sin. Only then can our prayers pierce through heaven’s gates:</p>

      <div class="quote-bible">
        If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. — 1 John 1:9
      </div>

      <p>Repentance is not merely saying “sorry” but turning away from sin. When we do this, Christ covers us with His righteousness—and our prayers become powerful.</p>

      <div class="quote-bible">
        The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. — James 5:16
      </div>

      <div class="quote-sop">
        Prayer and faith will do what no power on earth can accomplish. — Ministry of Healing, p. 509
      </div>

      <h3>A Promise of Healing and Restoration</h3>
      <p>God longs to hear and answer our prayers. But He sets the condition clearly:</p>

      <div class="quote-bible">
        If My people, which are called by My name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. — 2 Chronicles 7:14
      </div>

      <p>When we align our hearts with heaven—through repentance, obedience, and faith in Christ—our prayers are no longer abominable. They are heard, treasured, and answered according to God’s perfect will.</p>

      <div class="quote-sop">
        Christ’s righteousness alone can avail for His people. This is the covering which the Lord Himself has provided; the “fine linen, clean and white,” which is the righteousness of saints. — Testimonies to Ministers, p. 65
      </div>

      <h3>Final Appeal</h3>
      <p>Dear reader, search your heart. Are you cherishing any known sin? If so, let it go. Come to Jesus just as you are. Confess, repent, and trust in His righteousness. Then you can pray boldly, knowing your prayers ascend—not as an abomination—but as a fragrance pleasing to God.</p>
