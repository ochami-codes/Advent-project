    <p>
      Trifling with hearts basically means playing with someone’s affections and emotions in a careless 
      and selfish way, especially in matters involving love. It is not merely a mistake of youthful ignorance—
      it is a sin against God and against one’s neighbor. 
    </p>

      Trifling with hearts is a crime of no small magnitude in the sight of a holy God.

    <p>
      If this evil was only in the world, its consequences would be serious enough. But how much worse it is 
      when it creeps into the house of God! Many professing Christians draw the attention of someone, flatter 
      them with professions of love, and awaken hopes of marriage. Yet after satisfying selfish desires or pride, 
      they cruelly withdraw their affections, leaving behind wounded and broken hearts. Such conduct not only 
      injures the innocent but also brings reproach upon Christ’s name.

    <h2>A Betrayal of Trust</h2>
    <p>
      The Bible warns us about deceitful dealings in relationships.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="bible">
      With flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.
      <span class="ref">Psalm 12:2</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      When one stirs up emotions and affections with no genuine intention of commitment, 
      it is bearing false witness against a neighbor (Exodus 20:16). God’s law calls His 
      people to truth, faithfulness, and purity in all relationships.
    </p>

    <h2>A Sin Against Purity</h2>
    <blockquote class="bible">
      Abstain from all appearance of evil.
      <span class="ref">1 Thessalonians 5:22</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Paul exhorts the church to treat one another with holy regard. He also teaches that 
      <strong>“no whoremonger, nor unclean person... hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God”</strong> 
      (Ephesians 5:5). To awaken love that one has no intention of honoring in a godly union is to trifle with purity 
      and mock God’s sacred design for marriage.
    </p>

    <h2>Spirit of Prophecy Warnings</h2>
    <blockquote class="sop">
      Trifling with hearts is a crime of no small magnitude in the sight of a holy God. And yet some will show 
      preferences for young ladies, engage their affections, and then coolly withdraw their attentions, and 
      seem to feel very easy in the matter. They will be called to account for this in the day of God.

    <blockquote class="sop">
      A great responsibility rests upon those who enter into courtship. If they are guided by selfish inclinations, 
      disregarding the result of their course of action, they are trifling with the hearts of others, and in doing 
      so they are sinning against God.

    <h2>Psychological and Scientific Insights</h2>
    <blockquote class="science">
      Betrayal in romantic contexts often triggers symptoms similar to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
      including anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and depression.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="science">
      Emotional manipulation or abandonment can lead to trust issues in later life, affecting both friendships 
      and future marriages.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="science">
      Neuroscience reveals that love and attachment release oxytocin and dopamine. When bonds are suddenly broken, 
      the brain reacts similarly to withdrawal from addictive substances, intensifying feelings of rejection and loss.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="science">
      Chronic stress from heartbreak weakens the immune system, disrupts sleep, and increases risk of cardiovascular problems.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>The Call to Holy Relationships</h2>
    <blockquote class="bible">
      Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.
      <span class="ref">Matthew 7:12</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A true Christian will never toy with another’s affections but will act with honesty, purity, and prayerfulness 
      in all matters of the heart.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Trifling with hearts may seem like a small or hidden matter, but in God’s eyes it is a great sin. 
      It betrays trust, damages lives, and dishonors the sacred name of Christ. Modern psychology affirms 
      what Scripture already declares: playing with emotions has long-term effects on mental, spiritual, 
      and even physical health.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="sop">
      Let every step in courtship be characterized by modesty, simplicity, sincerity, and an earnest purpose to please and honor God.
