    <h1>Must I Be Financially Stable To Marry?</h1>
  </div>

  <main>
    <p>
      The world’s view of marriage has been corrupted so badly that even the church has not escaped its influence. Today, many believe that financial wealth is the greatest determinant of whether a marriage will stand. Society has raised an invisible standard: one must be “financially loaded” to attract someone’s daughter, pay dowry, and fund a wedding. As a result, many young men have given up on marriage altogether, fearing the responsibilities attached to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      But what does the Author of marriage say? To understand God’s will, we must go back to the sacred pages of Scripture.
    </p>

    <h2>God’s Pattern in Eden</h2>
    <p>
      God Himself officiated the first marriage. He did not leave Adam and Eve to chance but prepared them in a way that shows us His principles for marriage readiness.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
      <span class="ref">— Genesis 2:15 (KJV)</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Before giving Adam a wife, God gave him:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>A Home</strong> – Adam was placed in Eden, a beautiful and secure dwelling.</li>
      <li><strong>An Occupation</strong> – He was commanded to “dress and keep” the garden, showing that a man must not be idle.</li>
      <li><strong>A Relationship with God</strong> – Adam walked and communed with his Maker.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.
      <span class="ref">— Genesis 2:18 (KJV)</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>The Right Kind of Financial Stability</h2>
    <p>
      The Bible does not teach that a man must be rich or extravagant before marriage. Rather, he must be able to provide for the basic needs of his household.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
      <span class="ref">— 1 Timothy 5:8 (KJV)</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Financial stability in God’s eyes is not measured by wealth, luxury, or display, but by the ability to sustain a family in simplicity and godliness.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      Love should be sanctified by principle. A Christian should not enter upon the marriage relation until the matter has been carefully and prayerfully considered from every standpoint, and with an eye single to the glory of God. Worldly policy should have no weight in this matter. God’s glory should be the question paramount.
      <span class="ref">— Adventist Home, p. 49.2</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      An aimless life is a living death. The man who is unemployed, who is not doing service for God and for humanity, is losing the respect of himself and of God. Idleness opens the door to temptation.
      <span class="ref">— Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 280.1</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Thus, before marriage, a young man must ensure he has:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A modest home or dwelling (no need for extravagance).</li>
      <li>An occupation or trade that provides stability.</li>
      <li>A living connection with Christ, for He is the true Provider.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Balance and Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      So, must you be financially stable to marry? Yes—but biblical stability, not worldly extravagance. God requires diligence, responsibility, and the ability to provide for a family’s basic needs, not luxury cars, expensive weddings, or showy dowries.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      True love is a high and holy principle, altogether different in character from that love which is awakened by impulse and which suddenly dies when severely tested. True love is deep and abiding. It is not dependent upon outward circumstances.
      <span class="ref">— Messages to Young People, p. 435.3</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Marriage should be built upon faith in God, contentment, and a readiness to fulfill sacred duties, not upon worldly measures of wealth. If you have a home, a means of livelihood, and a walk with God, then you are ready for Him to bring a “help meet” for you.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
      <span class="ref">— Matthew 6:33 (KJV)</span>
