    “<strong>Man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.</strong>” This union, of course, is expressed through sexual intimacy. Paul emphasizes in 1 Corinthians that sexual relations create a form of oneness—even with a prostitute—highlighting the sacred bond sex is meant to establish within marriage.
  </p>

  <p>
    God’s design for sex is not merely physical; it is intended to unite husband and wife, fostering emotional, spiritual, and relational oneness. Yet, just as with every perfect gift from God—such as the Sabbath—the enemy has created a counterfeit, twisting God’s holy design for sex into something perverse and destructive.
  </p>

  <p>
    In our world today, sexual activity often ignores boundaries, age, or marital status, resulting in bitter consequences that harm individuals, families, and our relationship with God.

  <p>
    In this series, we will explore worldly sexual practices that defy God’s will, examine their tragic consequences, and learn how to honor and appreciate sex as the sacred gift God intended.
