            <h2>Christ's Mission to Earth</h2>

                <p>Over all the universe, one spot tainted its glory. The dark spot had been tainted with a deadly virus called sin, how will the King of the Universe contain it? The planet was now under the control of the devil and death and decay reigned supreme. Who will resque the planet and its inhabitants? There was One who was willing to go on a resque mission, at the expense of His own life. The Son of God gave Himself for the guilty human race!</p>
                
                <h2>When the Time was Right</h2>
                
                <p>At last, when the world sat in darkness and sin seemed triumphant, the promise was fulfilled:
                </p> 
                <blockquote>“When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son” (Galatians 4:4).
                </blockquote>

                  <p>Christ didn’t come in grandeur, but as a helpless babe in a manger. His mission wasn’t to overthrow governments or command armies. It was far greater: 
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>“Thou shalt call His name JESUS: for He shall save His people from their sins” (Matthew 1:21).
                  </blockquote>

                    <p>Ellen White describes this incredible condescension:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>“Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated as He deserves… He suffered the death which was ours, that we might receive the life which was His." (Desire of Ages, p. 25) </blockquote>

                    <p>His entire life was one of humility, service, and self-denial. He healed the sick, comforted the broken, and taught truth in love. But His greatest work was at the cross. There, the debt of sin was paid in full. “It is finished,” He cried not in defeat, but in triumph (John 19:30). The way to eternal life had been reopened.</p>

                    <p>Christ’s mission was and is redemptive. He came not just to forgive, but to transform.</p>
                    <blockquote> “For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil” (1 John 3:8).
                    </blockquote> He came to reveal the Father’s love and restore in us the image of God.</p>
