        <h2>The First Sabbath Choir in the New Jerusalem</h2>

        <div class="quote-bible">
            From one Sabbath to another, all flesh shall come to worship before Me,” says the Lord. — Isaiah 66:23
        </div>

        <p>The New Jerusalem shines in the distance, a radiant city prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. It is the first Sabbath since God has restored the universe, and every redeemed soul — from Adam to the last believer rescued from Earth’s final trial — is making their way to the great plaza before the throne.</p>

        <p>The sea of glass lies before you, glistening like crystal under the light of God’s glory. Every step across its smooth surface reflects colors no human eye had ever seen in the old world. Angels stand along the path — not as guards, but as joyful welcomers, their faces glowing with uncontainable delight.</p>

        <p>And there, at the center of it all, is <strong>Jesus</strong>. Not just as King of kings, not just as Savior of the world — but as the <em>Chorister of Heaven</em>. His robe shines brighter than the morning, and yet His presence feels warmer than a friend’s embrace. His eyes meet yours for a moment, and you know — deep in your soul — that you are home.</p>

        <p>He raises His hands.</p>

        <p>One note flows from His lips. It’s unlike any sound you’ve heard before — alive, radiant, and so rich that it stirs every fiber of your being. It’s not merely heard; it’s felt. It moves through your chest like a warm river, sweeping away every shadow of sorrow forever.</p>

        <p>Without hesitation, you join in. The person beside you does the same. Then the next, and the next — until the song of the redeemed swells into a tide of praise so vast it shakes the very air. Billions of voices blend perfectly, each unique yet united in a single melody: the song of victory through the Lamb’s blood.</p>

        <p>The angels add their harmonies, voices like streams of silver winding through a golden sea of sound. Even the walls of the New Jerusalem seem to hum in resonance, as if the city itself is an instrument in God’s symphony. Every note tells a story — of prayers answered, of battles fought and won by grace, of graves opened by the voice of the Savior.</p>

        <p>When the last chord comes, it lingers in the air, shimmering like light. Jesus lowers His hands and smiles — a smile that reaches into eternity.</p>

        <p><strong>“Welcome home… Happy Sabbath.”</strong></p>

        <div class="quote-sop">
            That day is not far. The invitation is already extended. Until then, may our worship here on Earth be a rehearsal — not in perfection of sound, but in sincerity of heart — for that great first Sabbath in the city of God.
