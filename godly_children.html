      <h2>1. Children Are a Heritage from the Lord</h2>
      <p>The Bible reminds us that children are not merely ours—they are God's gift and should be raised with reverence and purpose.</p>
      <blockquote class="bible-quote">
        "Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward." — Psalm 127:3
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="sop-quote">
        "Children are the Lord’s heritage, and we are answerable to Him for our management of His property." — <i>Child Guidance</i>, p. 43
      </blockquote>

      <h2>2. Early Training Shapes the Future</h2>
      <p>The early years are crucial. Teaching obedience, reverence, and love for God in childhood lays a strong spiritual foundation.</p>
      <blockquote class="bible-quote">
        "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it." — Proverbs 22:6
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="sop-quote">
        "The lessons that the child learns during the first seven years of life have more to do with forming his character than all that it learns in future years." — <i>Child Guidance</i>, p. 193
      </blockquote>

      <h2>3. Home as the First School</h2>
      <p>Parents are the first teachers. A godly home environment, filled with prayer and the Word of God, is the best school for character development.</p>
      <blockquote class="sop-quote">
        "The home should be to the children the most attractive place in the world, and the mother’s presence should be its greatest charm." — <i>Adventist Home</i>, p. 21
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="bible-quote">
        "And these words... thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children... and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house." — Deuteronomy 6:6-7
      </blockquote>

      <h2>4. Teaching by Example</h2>
      <p>Children learn more by what they see than what they are told. A parent’s own walk with God is a powerful influence.</p>
      <blockquote class="sop-quote">
        "By their own example, parents are to show the value of self-control, obedience, and reverence." — <i>Child Guidance</i>, p. 216
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="bible-quote">
        "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven." — Matthew 5:16
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Raising godly children is a high calling that requires prayer, patience, and the guidance of God’s Word. With Christ as the center of the home, parents can raise a generation that will stand faithful in a world of compromise. Let us press forward, relying on God's strength, as we train our children for heaven.</p>
