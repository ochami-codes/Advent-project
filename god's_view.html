    <h1>God's View: Heaven's Purpose for Marriage</h1>

      <h2>3.Heaven's Purpose for Marriage</h2>
   <p>
      Long before the world began—back in the mysterious ages of eternity—rebellion took root in the heart of a highly honored cherub. Lucifer, once radiant with heaven’s light, chose to nurture pride and ambition. This quiet revolt escalated into full-scale war in heaven. The outcome? Lucifer and a third of the angels were cast out, leaving a tragic void in heaven’s family.
    </p>

    <p>
      But God had a plan to fill this vacancy—a plan filled with grace and purpose. That plan was <strong>marriage</strong>. Not merely for companionship, but for character formation and the multiplication of godly offspring fit for His eternal kingdom.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      “And did not He make one? Yet had He the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That He might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.”<br />
      <cite>—Malachi 2:15</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      God, who could have created a million souls in a breath, chose instead to join one man and one woman in holy unity. Why? To seek a “godly seed”—children raised in homes where His love, law, and character are uplifted. Marriage, when patterned after divine principles, becomes heaven’s appointed method to restore what was lost.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      “God created man for His own glory, that after test and trial the human family might become one with the heavenly family. It was God’s purpose to repopulate heaven with the human family, if they would show themselves obedient to His every word.”<br />
      <cite>—SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 1, p. 1082 (Manuscript 58, 1900)</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The word “repopulate” implies something was emptied. Heaven lost a third of its angels. But through Christ’s redeeming power, God is now gathering candidates for restoration—those who choose to follow Him faithfully, and those raised in homes that reflect His image.
    </p>

    <p>
      Friend, this is no side mission. God has no backup plan. The family unit—rooted in godly marriage—is His only method for forming trustworthy citizens for eternity. This is why Satan fights the home so fiercely. Every godly marriage is a fortress for heaven, and every child trained in righteousness is a potential heir of glory.
    </p>

    <p>
      So what is God's view? That His children form marriages grounded in His Word, committed to love and truth, and fruitful in raising generations who will shine forever in the courts of heaven.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      “The home should be to the children the most attractive place in the world, and the mother’s presence should be its greatest charm.”<br />
      <cite>—Adventist Home, p. 21</cite>
