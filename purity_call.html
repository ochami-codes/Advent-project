    <h1>Call For Purity</h1>

  <main>
    <p>
      The world today has perverted the holy ways of God in matters of sex, love, and intimacy. 
      What God intended for purity, beauty, and sacredness has been corrupted into lust, immorality, 
      and selfish pleasure. Adultery, pornography, masturbation, fornication, polygamy, homosexuality, 
      and trifling with hearts all stand in direct opposition to God’s design for humanity. 
      These practices not only degrade the soul but also dishonor the Creator who made us in His image.
    </p>

    <p>
      As children of God, we are called out and set apart for holiness, to be living witnesses of His transforming grace. 
      The apostle Peter reminds us:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; 
      that ye should shew forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvellous light: 
      which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, 
      but now have obtained mercy.
      <span class="ref">— 1 Peter 2:9–10</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This is not merely a title, but a divine responsibility. To be God’s chosen people means that every aspect of our lives—
      including our bodies, relationships, and desires—must reflect His holiness. The standard of purity is not set by the 
      shifting culture of this world, but by the eternal Word of God.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove 
      what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
      <span class="ref">— Romans 12:2</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Holiness begins in the heart. Of ourselves, we cannot cleanse the mind or keep the body temple pure for the indwelling 
      of the Holy Spirit. But Christ, who cleansed the earthly temple from corruption, is able also to cleanse the temple of our hearts. 
      His promise is sure:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you… and I will put my Spirit within you, 
      and cause you to walk in my statutes.
      <span class="ref">— Ezekiel 36:26–27</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      The Saviour’s work of cleansing the heart from sin is represented by the cleansing of the temple. 
      He will not tolerate evil in any form. All selfishness, all evil practices, He will drive from the soul temple. 
      All covetousness, all unhallowed ambition, all impure practices, Christ will cleanse from the heart.
      <span class="ref">— The Desire of Ages, p. 161</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      In a world full of immorality and exceeding wickedness, God calls His people to be the “salt of the earth” and the “light of the world.” 
      Just as salt preserves from corruption, so the pure lives of God’s children preserve society from complete moral decay. 
      Our conduct, words, and relationships are to be a living testimony of Christ’s power to transform.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      The greatest evidence of the power of Christianity that can be presented to the world is a well-ordered, 
      well-disciplined family. This will recommend the truth as nothing else can, for it is a living witness of 
      its practical power upon the heart.
      <span class="ref">— The Adventist Home, p. 32</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Purity is not only about avoiding sin but also about revealing Christ in how we interact with others. 
      When the world looks at us, may it not see conformity to its lusts, but rather the character of Christ shining forth 
      in modesty, self-control, and holiness. This is the high calling of God’s remnant people—to be emblems of His grace 
      in a dark and corrupted generation.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
      <span class="ref">— Matthew 5:8</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
