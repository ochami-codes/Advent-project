    <h1>Biblical Courtship</h1>
  </div>
  <main class="content-container">
      
    <p>As the world sinks into immorality and every vain passion associated with human relationships, God’s children are called to follow the <strong>ancient paths</strong> –Jeremiah 6:16. The sacred institution of marriage, as designed by the Creator, must begin with a process guided by purity, principle, and divine purpose. Courtship, when done God’s way, reflects heaven’s order, not the world's chaos.</p>

    <p>Just as we consult God’s Word when making decisions about health, faith, and ministry, so we must <strong>seek divine guidance</strong> in matters of the heart—especially the path leading to marriage.</p>

    <h2>1. Isaac and Rebekah: A Courtship of Prayer and Providence</h2>
    <p><span class="bible">Genesis 24</span></p>
    <p>Isaac’s marriage was not the result of flirtation or feelings—it was <strong>bathed in prayer and directed by providence</strong>. Abraham’s servant, tasked with finding a wife, prayed specifically for God’s sign. When Rebekah passed the test of character and hospitality, the servant worshipped God and honored the family's role in the decision.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      “The servant asked the Lord for a sign, and when it was fulfilled, he gave thanks and glorified God before making any move.”  
      <footer>— Genesis 24:12–27</footer>

    <h2>2. Ruth and Boaz: A Courtship of Honor and Integrity</h2>
    <p>Book of Ruth</p>
    <p>Ruth was known for her virtue, not her beauty or style. Boaz noticed her <strong>character, work ethic, and loyalty</strong>. He ensured that everything about their relationship was <strong>done publicly, legally, and honorably</strong>. There was no secrecy, lust, or emotional manipulation.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      "Blessed be thou of the Lord...for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman."  
      <footer>— Ruth 3:10–11</footer>

    <h2>3. Joseph and Mary: A Courtship of Purity and Responsibility</h2>
    <p><span class="bible">Matthew 1:18–25</span></p>
    <p>Joseph and Mary were betrothed, meaning they were committed to marry but <strong>had not yet come together physically</strong>. Even when faced with a situation he didn’t understand (Mary’s pregnancy), Joseph sought to handle it <strong>with dignity, purity, and care</strong>.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      "Joseph...was a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily."  
      <footer>— Matthew 1:19</footer>

    <h2>Steps for a Godly Courtship Today</h2>
    <p>The Bible and Spirit of Prophecy provide <strong>timeless principles</strong> that youth can apply today as they seek God’s will in relationships:</p>

    <h3>1. Seek God First</h3>
    <blockquote class="bible">"In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths."  
      <footer>— Proverbs 3:6</footer>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="sop">"Let those who are contemplating marriage weigh every sentiment, and watch every development of character in the one with whom they think to unite their life destiny."  
      <footer>— Messages to Young People, p. 449</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>2. Involve Parents and Mentors</h3>
    <blockquote class="bible">"Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety."  
      <footer>— Proverbs 11:14</footer>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="sop">"Very few have correct views of the marriage relation. They are not careful to seek God’s guidance. They consult only their own desires and inclinations."  
      <footer>— Adventist Home, p. 70</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>3. Prioritize Character Over Charm</h3>
    <blockquote class="bible">"Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised."  
      <footer>— Proverbs 31:30</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>4. Set Boundaries and Remain Pure</h3>
    <blockquote class="bible">"Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life."  
      <footer>— Proverbs 4:23</footer>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="sop">"True love is a high and holy principle, altogether different in character from that love which is awakened by impulse."  
      <footer>— Adventist Home, p. 50</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>5. Evaluate Compatibility and Purpose</h3>
    <blockquote class="bible">"Can two walk together, except they be agreed?"  
      <footer>— Amos 3:3</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>6. Move Toward Marriage with Prayer and Clarity</h3>
    <blockquote class="sop">"Marriage is something that will influence and affect your life both in this world and in the world to come."  
      <footer>— Messages to Young People, p. 439</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Conclusion: A Relationship Heaven Can Smile Upon</h2>
    <p>Biblical courtship isn’t old-fashioned—it’s <strong>heaven-fashioned</strong>. It’s God’s design for His children to enter into marriage with peace, purity, and purpose. As the enemy works to destroy homes before they begin, may Christian youth rise to choose <strong>God’s way over the world’s ways</strong>—a path of honor, virtue, and lasting love.</p>

    <blockquote class="sop">"Marriage, a union for life, is a symbol of the union between Christ and His church."  
      <footer>— Adventist Home, p. 25</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Let’s return to the ancient path and let God write our love stories.</p>
