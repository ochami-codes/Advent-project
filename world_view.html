      <h2>2. The World’s View – A Distorted Vision</h2>

      <p>
        Modern marriages are so distorted that even youths who once looked forward to marriage now hesitate in fear and confusion. What was designed by God to be a source of joy and holiness has, in many cases, become a place of moral decay.
      </p>

      <p>
        Marriage beds have been defiled, becoming dens of iniquity where the basest passions and immoral acts are practiced. From pornography, domestic violence, and adultery, to unholy associations and casual betrayal, the sacredness of marriage has been largely cast aside.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="bible">
        “Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.” 
        <span class="ref">— Hebrews 13:4</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The world now views marriage as a contractual agreement for mutual benefit—something to be ended when convenience or personal satisfaction is no longer met. Character, virtue, and spiritual maturity are no longer considered prerequisites. Instead, wealth, beauty, and status have taken their place.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result? Incompatible unions, broken homes, and children growing up under the weight of confusion, trauma, and absent parents.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="sop">
        “The family tie is the closest, the most tender and sacred, of any on earth. It was designed to be a blessing to mankind. And it is a blessing wherever the marriage covenant is entered into intelligently, in the fear of God, and with due consideration for its responsibilities.” 
        <span class="ref">— Adventist Home, p. 340</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Sadly, even within the church, the world's view has crept in. Marriage is no longer seen as a sacred union for mutual sanctification and the raising of godly children. It has become bitter, burdensome, and unpopular.
      </p>

      <p>
        The world's redefinition of gender roles has further eroded the foundations. Husbands and wives no longer understand their biblical roles. Submission is mocked, leadership is abused, and mutual respect is forgotten.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="bible">
        “Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord... Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it.” 
        <span class="ref">— Ephesians 5:22,25</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Should we remain silent as marriage continues to sink into confusion and ruin? Absolutely not. We are called to be salt and light, to reflect heaven’s ideal and call the world—and the church—back to God’s original design.
