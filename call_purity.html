<h2>The Seventh Commandment Under Siege: A Call to Purity in a Corrupt Generation</h2>

<p>Men, women, youths, and even children—no one seems exempt. All are caught up. Caught up? Yes, caught up in adultery and fornication. Besides the Sabbath, there is perhaps no other commandment more openly and consistently violated than the seventh:</p> <p class="quote-bible">“Thou shalt not commit adultery” (Exodus 20:14).</p>

<p>Today, sex before marriage has become the norm, and even those within the sacred covenant of marriage often form unholy bonds outside their vows. The world celebrates what God condemns. Condoms and contraceptives are widely used, not merely for family planning within marriage, but as a license to sin without "consequences." Meanwhile, the pornographic industry thrives, and provocative dressing is now seen as empowerment, not perversion.</p>

<p>Society has blurred the lines. Boundaries are overrun. The aged no longer teach the young, and the young no longer respect the aged. Humanity has been turned into a parade of sex objects. God's sacred gift of intimacy, meant to be enjoyed within marriage, has been desecrated. Today, sex is no longer sacred, and the streets are runways of moral decay. It's become nearly impossible to walk without being assaulted by public displays of indecency.</p>

<p class="quote-bible"> “The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.”
— Proverbs 21:5</p>



<p>Where is the fear of God? Condoms and contraceptives may prevent disease and pregnancy, but what can shield us from the all-seeing eye of the Almighty? (Hebrews 4:13). What can shield the soul from the shame of sin?</p> <p class="quote-bible">“The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good” (Proverbs 15:3).</p>

<p>Even more grievous is the condition of our own churches, which have, in many cases, become spiritual brothels. Women enter the sanctuary dressed not for reverence, but for attention. Seduction has replaced sanctity, and fashion has become a greater concern than faith.</p>

<p class="quote-sop"> “Many who profess to be Christians are so in name only. They are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.”
— Ellen G. White, Messages to Young People, p. 82</p>



<p>Can anyone today clearly distinguish between the child of God and the child of the world? Their dress is the same, their talk is the same, their music is the same. Holiness is mocked, and purity is despised. Dare to speak about virginity or chastity, and you’ll be treated like a relic of the past. Say you’ve kept yourself for marriage, and you’ll be stared at like an alien.</p>

<p>Yet God has not changed, and His requirements remain the same:</p>
<p class="quote-bible">“This is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication” (1 Thessalonians 4:3).</p>

<p class="quote-sop"> “The greatest want of the world is the want of men, men who will not be bought or sold, men who in their inmost souls are true and honest... men who will stand for the right though the heavens fall.”
— Ellen G. White, Education, p. 57</p>



<p>Let us not forget that every impure act, every lustful thought, every broken boundary is not only a sin against our own bodies but a grief to the heart of Christ. The devil mocks our Saviour whenever he sees professed Christians living like the world. We are called to be a holy nation, a peculiar people (1 Peter 2:9), not a reflection of Babylon.</p>

<p>It’s time to return to purity. Not just of body, but of mind, heart, and spirit.</p>
