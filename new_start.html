  <h2 style="color:#4CAF50;">The Power of the NEWSTART Lifestyle</h2>

  <blockquote class="quote-bible">
    “Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.” – 1 Corinthians 10:31
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    In our modern world filled with stress, fast food, and lifestyle diseases, God has given us a simple yet powerful blueprint for health. It's called <strong>NEWSTART</strong>, an acronym that stands for <strong>Nutrition, Exercise, Water, Sunlight, Temperance, Air, Rest, and Trust in God</strong>. Rooted in both Scripture and science, this eight-part health plan is not just about living longer, it's about living abundantly in body, mind, and spirit.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Nutrition</strong> is the foundation of life. God gave us the original diet in Genesis 1:29, fruits, grains, nuts, and later vegetables.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="quote-sop">
    “Grains, fruits, nuts, and vegetables...impart a strength, a power of endurance, and a vigor of intellect that are not afforded by a more complex and stimulating diet.” – Counsels on Diet and Foods, p. 81
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    <strong>Exercise</strong> is God’s natural energizer. Regular movement strengthens the heart, supports mental clarity, and boosts immunity. Even Jesus walked from village to village, showing us the power of active living.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="quote-sop">
    “Walking, in all cases where it is possible, is the best remedy for diseased bodies.” – Ministry of Healing, p. 261
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    <strong>Water</strong> is a simple but powerful agent of health. Drinking enough pure water flushes toxins, supports organ function, and prevents dehydration. Jesus Himself used water in healing and ministry.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Sunlight</strong> is God's natural vitamin D supply. Moderate sunlight exposure lifts mood, strengthens bones, and supports immunity.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="quote-sop">
    “Rooms that are not exposed to sunlight become damp... disease germs flourish in dark places.” – Ministry of Healing, p. 274
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    <strong>Temperance</strong> means balance—avoiding harmful things and using good things moderately. This includes abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, and not overindulging in food, work, or even sleep.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="quote-sop">
    “True temperance teaches us to dispense entirely with everything hurtful.” – Temperance, p. 138
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    <strong>Air</strong> and <strong>Rest</strong> are gifts we often overlook. Fresh air boosts brain function, and Sabbath rest renews the soul. God Himself rested on the seventh day, giving us a divine example.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, <strong>Trust in God</strong> is the crown of the NEWSTART plan. Without it, true healing is incomplete.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="quote-sop">
    “The love which Christ diffuses through the whole being is a vitalizing power.” – Ministry of Healing, p. 115
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The NEWSTART lifestyle is not just health advice—it’s a return to God’s original plan for our well-being. It blends divine wisdom with scientific validation, offering healing and hope to a sick world. As we embrace these simple remedies, we draw closer to the Healer Himself.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="quote-bible">
    “Come unto me... and I will give you rest.” – Matthew 11:28
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong>Let us choose today to cooperate with heaven in preserving our health—for God’s glory and our mission’s success.</strong></p>
