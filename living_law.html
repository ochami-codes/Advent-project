 <h1>Living the Law – Practical Holiness</h1>
 
<p>God never intended His law to be just a set of rules written on stone. He desires it to be lived out daily in our thoughts, words, and actions. True obedience is practical holiness—reflecting Christ in every area of life. It is about more than just avoiding sin; it is about pursuing righteousness by grace.</p>

<p><strong>James 1:22</strong> urges,</p> 
<blockquote>“Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only.”
</blockquote> 
<p>Practical holiness is not theoretical, it is demonstrated in how we treat others, how we speak, and how we use our time. The Ten Commandments become a lifestyle of faithfulness, integrity, and compassion.
</p>

<p><strong>Titus 2:11–12</strong> teaches that the grace of God not only brings salvation but also 
</p>
<blockquote>“teaches us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly.” 
</blockquote>
<p>The law becomes alive in us through the Holy Spirit, enabling us to live differently from the world.</p>

<p>Ellen G. White says in Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 314:
</p>
<blockquote>“The righteousness of Christ is not a cloak to cover unconfessed and unforsaken sin; it is a principle of life that transforms the character and controls the conduct.”
</blockquote> 
<p>Obedience, then, is not just external—it's the fruit of an inward change.
</p>

<p><strong>Colossians 3:12–14</strong> calls us to put on compassion, kindness, humility, and love. This is the daily living out of God's law in relationships and duties. It’s in our homes, schools, workplaces, and churches that holiness is made visible. Practical obedience is the clearest witness of the gospel’s power.</p>


<h3>Practical Holiness is Consistent Surrender</h3>
<p>Living the law means embodying Christ’s character in everyday life. Practical holiness is not perfectionism, it’s consistent surrender and growth. As we abide in Jesus, His law becomes a joy to follow, and our lives shine as lights in a dark world.</p>
