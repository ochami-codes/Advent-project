    <h1>Christian Standards and End-Time Remnant</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In the last days, God calls a people to stand firm on His unchanging truth—His law and gospel. This faithful group, known as the end-time remnant, is characterized by obedience to God’s commandments and a vibrant relationship with Jesus.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”<br>
      <em>Revelation 14:12</em>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “The remnant church as the last light of truth shining in a dark world, called to prepare people for Christ’s soon return.”<br>
      <em>The Great Controversy, p. 613</em>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>The Importance of God’s Law</h2>
    <p>
      Christian standards are rooted in God’s holy law, summarized in the Ten Commandments. These commandments reveal God’s character and His will for our lives. Jesus Himself affirmed their ongoing importance.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law.”<br>
      <em>Matthew 5:18</em>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “The law of God is the foundation of all true education and the standard of all right living.”<br>
      <em>Education, p. 131</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Obedience to God’s law is not legalism but love in action.
    </p>

    <h2>Holiness and Separation from the World</h2>
    <p>
      The remnant church is called to holiness and separation from worldly practices that contradict God’s standards. Paul urged believers to separate themselves from worldly influences.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Come out from among them, and be ye separate.”<br>
      <em>2 Corinthians 6:17</em>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “The remnant people are to be distinguished from the world by their godly life.”<br>
      <em>Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 5, p. 214</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      True holiness shines as a witness to God’s transforming power.
    </p>

    <h2>Living the Faith of Jesus</h2>
    <p>
      The remnant’s faith is not passive but active and vibrant. It involves trusting Christ daily, overcoming sin, and witnessing to others. Faith is linked closely with obedience.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “The faith of Jesus will be revealed in the remnant church by works of righteousness.”<br>
      <em>The Great Controversy, p. 624</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This faith keeps the remnant steadfast amid trials and persecution.
    </p>

    <h2>The Mission of the Remnant</h2>
    <p>
      God’s remnant church has a worldwide mission to proclaim the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14. This includes warning of judgment, calling people to worship God alone, and preparing them for Jesus’ soon return.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “The message of the third angel is to be proclaimed with a loud voice, a message of warning and of hope to the world.”<br>
      <em>Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 6, p. 19</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Upholding Christian standards is essential to this mission, as the remnant demonstrates God’s truth in word and deed.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Christian standards are not burdensome rules but God’s loving guideposts that prepare His people for Christ’s return. The end-time remnant stands as a faithful witness, reflecting God’s law and the faith of Jesus in a world that increasingly rejects both.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “The remnant people are to be clothed with the righteousness of Christ.”<br>
      <em>The Great Controversy, p. 611</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Let us live faithfully, shining as lights in the last days.
