      <h2>Faithfulness in a Faithless Generation</h2>
    <section class="card">
      <p>In our current world, strict obedience to the commandments of God is often seen as outdated or burdensome. But must this be the case for a true child of God?</p>

      <p>Will a sincere believer choose to keep the Sabbath or compromise for work? Will a converted daughter of God honor the seventh commandment or yield to the advances of her boss? Can a Christian businessperson maintain strict integrity while dealing with customers?</p>

      <p>Is it really true that obeying God brings more hardship than blessing? The Lord Himself addressed this struggle:</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        “Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts? And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.”<br><b>– Malachi 3:14–15</b>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Aren’t the wicked the ones who seem to prosper while the faithful suffer? Even the psalmist wrestled with this thought:</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        “For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. They are not in trouble as other men... Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.”<br><b>– Psalm 73:3,5,12</b>
      </blockquote>

      <p>What changed his perspective?</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        “When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end. Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction. How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment!”<br><b>– Psalm 73:16–19</b>
      </blockquote>

      <p>God's patience may make the wicked bold, but their end is sure.</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        “Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil... Yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God.”<br><b>– Ecclesiastes 8:11–13</b>
      </blockquote>

      <p>It shall be well with those who fear God. But how can we live in this world trusting in God, seeing His commandments not as burdens but as blessings?</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-sop">
        “With the same temptation Satan approaches men... He requires that they sacrifice integrity, disregard conscience, indulge selfishness.”<br><b>– Desire of Ages, p. 130.2</b>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Jesus, our example, shows the better path:</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-sop">
        “In the presence of the witnessing universe, He testified that it is a less calamity to suffer whatever may befall than to depart in any manner from the will of God... Perhaps it appears that obedience to some plain requirement of God will cut off his means of support.”<br><b>– Desire of Ages, p. 121.2</b>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="quote-sop">
        “But the only thing in our world upon which we can rely is the word of God... ‘Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.’”<br><b>– Matthew 6:33; DA 121.2</b>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Our only questions should be: “What is God’s command?” and “What is His promise?” Obey the first. Trust the second.</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-sop">
        “In the last great conflict... they will be forbidden to buy or sell... But to the obedient is given the promise, ‘Bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.’”<br><b>– Isaiah 33:16; DA 121.3</b>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Suffering for the Sabbath? For purity? For integrity? Rejected by friends or family because of your faithfulness?</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”<br><b>– Revelation 2:10</b>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Stay faithful. Heaven is watching, and the reward is sure.</p>
