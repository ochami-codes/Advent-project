    <h1>Masturbation: Does God Approve?</h1>
  </header>

  <!-- Main Content -->

    <p>
      By definition, masturbation is the stimulation of one’s sexual organs with the aim of attaining sexual pleasure.  
      The world views it as a normal part of human life and even claims it is “necessary.” But does the God of the Bible sanction this?
    </p>

    <h2>God’s Original Plan for Sex and Intimacy</h2>
    <p>
      From the beginning, God designed sexuality with a sacred purpose — as the means of uniting man and woman in marriage.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="bible">
      Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
      <span class="ref">Genesis 2:24, KJV</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Sex was created as the means of bonding between husband and wife — physically, emotionally, and spiritually.  
      Masturbation, however, is a selfish distortion of this plan. Instead of “two becoming one,” it becomes “one with oneself.”
    </p>

    <h2>Effects of Masturbation</h2>

    <h3>1. Spiritual Consequences — A Barrier to Heaven</h3>
    <blockquote class="bible">
      Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
      <span class="ref">Matthew 5:28, KJV</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Self-abuse is sustained by sexual fantasies and impure imaginations. It enslaves the mind, making the soul unfit for heaven unless repented of.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="sop">
      If you destroy the moral sensibilities, you become a willing slave to Satan.
      <span class="ref">Messages to Young People, p. 63</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>2. Physical Health Effects</h3>
    <p>
      Each act of ejaculation causes the body to lose essential nutrients including <strong>zinc, selenium, and lecithin</strong>, which are vital for brain function, immunity, and fertility.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="science">
      Zinc deficiency is linked to low testosterone, hair loss, and poor immunity. Selenium plays a key role in sperm production and antioxidant defense; deficiency may cause fatigue and neurological problems.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="sop">
      Self-abuse is destroying the vital forces of the system. Nervous weakness, despondency, and greatly impaired digestion are generally the result.
      <span class="ref">Child Guidance, p. 439</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>3. Psychological and Emotional Harm</h3>
    <p>
      The temporary pleasure is quickly followed by guilt, shame, and low self-esteem. This emotional cycle weakens willpower and confidence, reducing natural desire for one’s spouse and opening the door to perversions.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="sop">
      The practice of secret vice soon disorders all the faculties of the mind. It weakens the memory and enfeebles the intellect.
      <span class="ref">Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 349</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>4. Dangers of Insanity and Nervous Disorders</h3>
    <blockquote class="sop">
      Self-abuse is the cause of untold sufferings to thousands. It is destroying the nervous system, enfeebling the body, and affecting the brain. Some have even become insane.
      <span class="ref">Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 347</span>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="science">
      Modern psychiatry shows that pornography-driven masturbation alters brain reward circuits, leading to addiction, anxiety, depression, and in severe cases mental instability.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Hope for the Struggling Soul</h2>
    <blockquote class="bible">
      If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
      <span class="ref">1 John 1:9, KJV</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Victory comes through Christ — by surrender, prayer, guarding the mind, filling the life with active service, and surrounding oneself with holy influences.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="sop">
      Christ is ready to set us free from the slavery of sin, but He does not force the will. If we are willing to be made free, He will set us free indeed.
      <span class="ref">Steps to Christ, p. 47</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Masturbation is neither “normal” nor “necessary.” It perverts God’s design, damages health, robs the soul of peace, and endangers mental stability.  
      But through Christ, there is forgiveness and transforming power.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="bible">
      Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
      <span class="ref">2 Corinthians 7:1, KJV</span>
