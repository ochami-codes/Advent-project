          <h1>Preparing for the Sabbath</h1>
          
<p>The Sabbath is not only a day of rest and worship but also a sacred appointment with our Creator. Just as we prepare for important events in life like weddings or interviews God invites us to prepare for His holy day. True Sabbath-keeping begins before the sun sets on Friday. The Bible and Spirit of Prophecy both emphasize the beauty and importance of Sabbath preparation, showing how it shapes our experience and honors God.</p>

<h2>Early Preparations is Key</h2>
<p>God gave the principle of Sabbath preparation in Exodus 16, during the giving of the manna. The Israelites were to gather a double portion on the sixth day because no manna would fall on the Sabbath (Exodus 16:5, 23). This practice taught them to plan ahead and treat the Sabbath as a holy, uninterrupted time with God. The sixth day was therefore called “the preparation day” (Luke 23:54), a term still used in reference to Friday.</p>

<p>Sabbath preparation includes both physical and spiritual readiness. Ellen White counsels,</p> 
<blockquote>“On Friday let the preparation for the Sabbath be completed. See that all the clothing is in readiness and that all the cooking is done… This is the time to direct the mind to the Sabbath and to God” (Child Guidance, p. 528).
</blockquote>
<p>By completing our work ahead of time, we enter the Sabbath peacefully, without distractions. This not only honors the commandment but protects the sacredness of the experience.</p>

<p>Sabbath preparation should also include cleaning our homes and our hearts. Cluttered surroundings often create distracted minds. A tidy, peaceful environment helps set a tone of reverence. More importantly, our hearts should be examined. Confession, prayer, and reconciliation with others help us welcome the Sabbath with joy and purity.</p>
<blockquote> “Let every preparation be made to honor the day which God has blessed and sanctified” (Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 6, p. 356).</blockquote>

<p>Family preparation is also key. Children should be trained to expect and love the Sabbath. Through storytelling, singing, and special meals, the Sabbath can be made a delight (Isaiah 58:13–14). Preparing together as a family teaches responsibility and builds anticipation for the holy hours. Jesus said, “The Sabbath was made for man” (Mark 2:27), and preparation ensures we fully enjoy this gift.</p>

<p>Finally, spiritual preparation includes setting aside time to reflect on God’s word before the Sabbath begins. Reading the Bible, meditating on the week’s blessings, and setting spiritual goals for the Sabbath make the experience richer. The more we invest in preparation, the more deeply we connect with God during the sacred hours. Ellen White writes,</p> 
<blockquote>“When the Sabbath is thus remembered, the temporal will not be allowed to encroach upon the spiritual” (Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 6, p. 353).</blockquote>

<h3>The Sabbath is Our Date with God</h3>
<p>Preparing for the Sabbath is a sacred duty and a joyful privilege. It is a way to say to God, “You are important to me. I’m making room for You.” When we prepare well, we step into the Sabbath not with stress or hurry, but with peace and expectation. As we train ourselves and our families to honor the preparation day, we help restore the true spirit of the Sabbath. “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8), and that remembering begins long before sunset on Friday.</p>
