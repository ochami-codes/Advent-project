    <h1>Adultery: A Sin Against God and Marriage</h1>
  </header>

  <!-- Main Content -->
  <main>
    <p>
      Adultery is not just about physical unfaithfulness—it begins in the heart, in words, 
      in secret affections, and in careless actions. Today, broken boundaries, flirty words, 
      late-night secret communications, improper gestures, and touchy hands have sadly become 
      common even among married men and women. Yet, God calls it what it is: sin, exceedingly 
      sinful in His sight.
    </p>

    <h2>God’s Command Against Adultery</h2>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Thou shalt not commit adultery.
      <span class="ref">(Exodus 20:14)</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: 
      But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed 
      adultery with her already in his heart.
      <span class="ref">(Matthew 5:27–28)</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Marriage is a sacred covenant. The affection, tender words, and gestures of love of a married 
      person must be reserved only for their spouse. To bestow them elsewhere is to rob God and one’s 
      partner of what rightfully belongs in marriage.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      Be as true as steel to your marriage vows, refusing, in thought, word, or deed, to spoil your record 
      as a man who fears God and obeys His commandments.
      <span class="ref">Adventist Home, p. 104.1</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>The Sacredness of Marriage</h2>

    <p>
      Marriage vows are not mere words spoken at the altar—they are solemn promises before God. 
      To trifle with them is to dishonor heaven.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      The law of God is plainly written in the New Testament Scriptures. Adultery is there mentioned 
      as one of the sins that will close the gates of the Holy City against the transgressor.
      <span class="ref">Adventist Home, p. 341</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The marriage bed must be kept pure. God requires faithfulness not only in deeds but also 
      in thoughts and attitudes.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is Adultery Prevalent in the Church?</h2>

    <p>
      Tragically, worldliness has crept into the church. Fashion displays, low necklines, tight dresses, 
      short skirts, and revealing clothing have turned the house of God into a place of temptation rather 
      than reverence.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      Fashion is deteriorating the morals of the youth. Its influence is to weaken the mind, to destroy 
      the love of simplicity, and to create in both young and old a passion for dress and display.
      <span class="ref">Child Guidance, p. 432</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      When professed Christians act carelessly or dress immodestly, they not only dishonor God but also 
      become stumbling blocks to others.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that 
      a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
      <span class="ref">(Matthew 18:6)</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Practical Steps to Guard Against Adultery</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Guard the Thoughts</strong>  
        <blockquote class="bible">
          Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.
          <span class="ref">(Proverbs 4:23)</span>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote class="sop">
          Few realize that it is a duty to exercise control over the thoughts and imagination.
          <span class="ref">Mind, Character, and Personality, Vol. 2, p. 595</span>
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Avoid Familiarities and Tempting Situations</strong>  
        <blockquote class="bible">
          Abstain from all appearance of evil.
          <span class="ref">(1 Thessalonians 5:22)</span>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote class="sop">
          Those who would preserve physical health, a sound understanding, and a good memory 
          must flee from the excitement of forbidden pleasures.
          <span class="ref">Child Guidance, p. 466</span>
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Dress Modestly and Encourage Modesty in the Church</strong>  
        <blockquote class="bible">
          In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness 
          and sobriety.
          <span class="ref">(1 Timothy 2:9)</span>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote class="sop">
          A modest God-fearing woman will dress modestly.
          <span class="ref">Messages to Young People, p. 344</span>
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Cherish and Nurture Your Marriage</strong>  
        <blockquote class="sop">
          Marriage has received Christ’s sanction and blessing, and it is to be regarded 
          as a sacred institution.
          <span class="ref">Adventist Home, p. 25</span>
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Pray and Stay Connected to Christ</strong>  
        <blockquote class="bible">
          Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, 
          but the flesh is weak.
          <span class="ref">(Matthew 26:41)</span>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote class="sop">
          The strongest temptation cannot excuse sin. However great the pressure brought to bear 
          upon the soul, transgression is our own act.
          <span class="ref">Great Controversy, p. 511</span>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      Adultery—in thoughts, words, or actions—is an abomination before God. It destroys homes, 
      cripples the church’s witness, and brings reproach upon the name of Christ. Let us guard 
      the sacredness of marriage, uphold purity in the church, and honor God by living faithfully. 
      May husbands and wives be “true as steel” to their vows, and may the church reflect Christ’s 
      holiness in every word, deed, and appearance.
