  <h1>💍 Waiting for a Godly Wife in a Godless Church Age</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Why Rarity Shouldn’t Make Believers Settle</p>
  <blockquote class="bible-quote">“A prudent wife is from the Lord.” — Proverbs 19:14</blockquote>

    <h2>🕯️ Introduction: The Church Has Forgotten Her Identity</h2>
    <p>We are living in the Laodicean age—an era where the church says, "I am rich and increased with goods," but in God’s eyes is "wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked." (Revelation 3:17). Many churches today are vibrant in outward activity but lack spiritual depth. Sadly, this condition affects young believers, especially in the area of relationships.</p>

    <blockquote class="sop-quote">
      “The prevailing sin of this generation is the indulgence of passion. Never was vice more bold, more daring, or more widely diffused. Sin does not blush.”
      — Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 2, p. 346
    </blockquote>

    <p>Those who desire modesty, purity, and mission-based marriages often find themselves feeling alone—even in faith communities. Yet this longing is not outdated—it is holy, heaven-approved, and deeply needed.</p>

    <h2>🌱 She Is Rare… and That’s Okay</h2>
    <p>Godly women may seem few, but they still exist. Women who:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Love God more than fashion,</li>
      <li>Fear the Lord more than trends,</li>
      <li>Dress to honor heaven rather than gain attention,</li>
      <li>Desire to build Spirit-filled homes...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>…are not extinct. They are simply faithful, often unnoticed, but precious in God's eyes.</p>

    <blockquote class="sop-quote">
      “The wife of your choice should possess purity of character, and the charm of true womanhood… She should love and honor God.”

    <h2>⚠️ Don’t Settle for “Almost”</h2>
    <p>In today’s culture, there is pressure to compromise:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Time is running out...”</li>
      <li>“Just find someone who goes to church.”</li>
      <li>“Change will come after marriage.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But marriage is not a rescue mission. It is a sacred covenant. Entering it without spiritual compatibility often leads to sorrow.</p>

    <blockquote class="sop-quote">
      “Few have correct views of the marriage relation... It is often the case that persons before marriage have little opportunity to become acquainted with each other’s habits and disposition. They are united in marriage without God, and the result is wretchedness.”
      — Adventist Home, p. 44
    </blockquote>

    <p>Choosing a life partner should be based on shared values, not mere appearances or church attendance.</p>

    <h2>🙏 Pray For the One You Haven’t Met</h2>
    <p>The right person may not yet be in one’s circle, but they are not beyond God’s reach. Believers can pray beyond their own needs—interceding for their future spouse’s spiritual journey:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Lord, protect them from deception.”</li>
      <li>“Strengthen their love for truth.”</li>
      <li>“Keep them pure and focused in a world that mocks holiness.”</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote class="sop-quote">
      “The prayers of the faithful will not be in vain. God hears every cry, even when no human ear does.”
      — Steps to Christ, p. 100

    <h2>💪 Preparing While Waiting</h2>
    <p>Before God gave Adam a wife, He gave him work, responsibility, and a purpose. The season of waiting should be active, not idle.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be rooted in God’s Word</li>
      <li>Serve the church and community faithfully</li>
      <li>Grow in emotional maturity and financial stewardship</li>
      <li>Strengthen personal and ministry goals with excellence</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote class="sop-quote">
      “Let a young man seek one who is a lover of God… but let him be one himself.”

    <h2>✝️ A Remnant Remains</h2>
    <p>Elijah once felt alone in his stand for truth, but God reminded him: “I have reserved seven thousand in Israel.” (1 Kings 19:18)</p>
    <p>Even in an age of compromise, God has a remnant. And those who stand for righteousness in relationships are not as alone as they feel.</p>

    <h2>❤️ Final Word: Waiting in Faith, Not Fear</h2>
    <p>The world says, “Lower your expectations.”<br>
    God says, “I’m writing a better story.”</p>

    <blockquote class="sop-quote">
      “Those who trust in Him will never be disappointed.”
      — Prophets and Kings, p. 175
    </blockquote>

    <p>There’s no shame in waiting. True love is not rushed. When God writes the love story, it is worth the wait.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible-quote">
      “Delight thyself also in the Lord; and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart.” — Psalm 37:4
