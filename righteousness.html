      <h2>Righteousness by Faith — Let God Do It!</h2>

      <p>I just learned something beautiful: God is willing to do everything for those who surrender fully to Him. Look at this promise:</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. <br>
        And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them. (Ezekiel 36:26–27)
      </blockquote>

      <p>Read those words again:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>“I will give you…”</li>
        <li>“I will put within you…”</li>
        <li>“I will take away…”</li>
        <li>“I will cause you to walk…”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>God is literally offering to do everything for us—if only we would allow Him.</p>

      <p>Longing for a holy, victorious, and righteous life? Then claim this promise. Let God do in you what you cannot do for yourself.</p>

      <p>King David understood this truth well. Listen to his prayer for Solomon:</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things… (1 Chronicles 29:19)
      </blockquote>

      <p>If only we grasped this truth: that only God can empower us to live righteously—we would truly reflect His image to the world.</p>

      <p>Let this be our daily prayer:</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        Order my steps in Thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me. (Psalm 119:133)
      </blockquote>

      <p>This, dear reader, is the essence of <strong>righteousness by faith</strong>. Let God write His law in your heart. Let Him work in you, both to will and to do of His good pleasure.</p>
