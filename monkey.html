      <h2>Even the Monkeys Kept the Sabbath</h2>
      <h3>Trusting God with Our Business, Work, and Well-being</h3>
      <p>Sometimes we worry too much. We wonder what will happen to our jobs, businesses, or land when we begin honoring God fully—especially in keeping the Sabbath.</p>
      <p>What if you lose your job because you refuse to work on Sabbath? What if customers vanish during those "lost" Sabbath hours? What if your profit margins drop because you close shop on the busiest day?</p>
      <p>And what about businesses built on unclean or questionable grounds—like pork, alcohol, drugs, or dishonest gain? What if obedience seems to cost too much?</p>
      <p>The temptation to compromise is real. But what does the Bible say?</p>

      <h3>1. Consider Your Ways – Haggai 1</h3>
      <div class="quote-bible">
        “You have sown much, and bring in little... Consider your ways” — Haggai 1:6-7
      </div>
      <p>In Haggai’s time, God’s people neglected His house while focusing on their own gain. As a result, their efforts yielded little. The Lord reminded them: when we put Him first, He takes care of our needs. Ignoring His instructions—even unintentionally—can bring drought into our spiritual and practical lives.</p>

      <h3>2. The Lord Rebukes the Devourer – Malachi 3</h3>
      <div class="quote-bible">
        “And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes... And all nations shall call you blessed” — Malachi 3:11-12
      </div>
      <p>When we return to God—faithfully and cheerfully—He promises not just spiritual blessings, but protection over our work, farms, and business. The <strong>devourer</strong> could be anything threatening your success. But God says, “I’ll deal with it for you.”</p>

      <h3>3. A Sabbath Promise – Exodus 20</h3>
      <div class="quote-bible">
        “Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work…” — Exodus 20:8–10
      </div>
      <p>Obedience to God’s commandments, including Sabbath observance, is not a burden but a blessing. It’s a day of trust—a weekly reminder that we are not sustained by hustle, but by the hand of God.</p>

      <h3>4. A True Story: Monkeys or Church?</h3>
      <p><strong>“The monkeys also kept the Sabbath.”</strong> — António Cuchata, Mozambique</p>
      <p>In coastal Mozambique, António Cuchata faced a real dilemma. His father wanted him to guard their crops from vervet monkeys every Saturday. The monkeys were aggressive pests—capable of destroying cassava, peanuts, beans, and more.</p>
      <p>But António had just given his life to Jesus and decided he would honor the Sabbath no matter what. He knelt and prayed, “Dear God, please stop the monkeys from coming to our farm while I’m at church.” Then he went to the Adventist church 15 miles away.</p>
      <p>That Sabbath, the monkeys didn’t come.  
         The next Sabbath? Still no monkeys.  
         Week after week, they stayed away.</p>
      <p>His father—though skeptical—watched the miracle unfold. António later testified with joy: <strong>“Even the monkeys kept the Sabbath.”</strong></p>

        “It is the Lord’s purpose that His followers shall be a blessing to the world by their obedience to His commandments. They are to show that obedience brings temporal and spiritual blessings.” — Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 6, p. 227

        “He who gave His only-begotten Son to die for you, has made a covenant with you. He who has clothed the lily of the field, will not leave you to perish.” — Ellen G. White, Signs of the Times, June 12, 1893

      <h3>Conclusion: Your Business Is God’s Business</h3>
      <p>You don’t have to break the Sabbath to survive.  
         You don’t need to trade principles for profits.  
         The same God who kept monkeys off the farm can keep your job, your harvest, and your soul.</p>
      <p><strong>If God can keep the monkeys, He can handle your customers too.</strong></p>

      <h3>Prayer</h3>
      <p>Dear Loving Father,</p>
      <p>You are the Source of all blessings, the Giver of every good gift. Today I come before You with a heart full of thanksgiving—for the Sabbath, for Your promises, and for the assurance that I do not walk this journey alone.</p>
      <p>Lord, You know my fears—about my job, my business, my future. You know how hard it can be to stand firm when everything around me seems to say, “Compromise.” But today I choose faith. I choose obedience. I choose to honor Your Sabbath day because I love You.</p>
      <p>Strengthen my faith when it's tested. Help me to remember that You fed Elijah by ravens, provided manna for Israel, and even kept monkeys away from António’s farm. Surely You can take care of me too.</p>
      <p>Rebuke every devourer in my life—seen or unseen—and make me a living testimony that those who honor You will never be forsaken. Bless my hands, my work, and my witness, so that others may see and glorify Your name.</p>
      <p>May I rest joyfully each Sabbath in Your presence, trusting fully in Your care. I give You my fears, my future, and my faith.</p>
      <p>In Jesus’ powerful and faithful name I pray, <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
