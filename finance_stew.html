    <h1>Financial Stewardship</h1>

    <p>Money is a powerful tool that can either serve God’s kingdom or become a snare that distracts us from Him. The Bible calls us to be faithful stewards of all God has entrusted to us, including our finances.</p>
    
    <blockquote>“Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful” (1 Corinthians 4:2).</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>“Our temporal possessions are entrusted to us by God, to be used to advance His cause” (<em>Counsels on Stewardship</em>, p. 27).</blockquote>
    
    <p>How we manage money reveals the true condition of our hearts.</p>

    <p>The foundation of Christian stewardship is recognizing that everything belongs to God.</p>
    
    <blockquote>“The earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof” (Psalm 24:1).</blockquote>
    
    <p>We are merely caretakers of His resources. This mindset frees us from greed and encourages generosity.</p>
    
    <blockquote>“The Lord calls for men and women who will consecrate their means to His service” (<em>Counsels on Stewardship</em>, p. 39).</blockquote>
    
    <p>Viewing money as God’s property transforms how we earn, save, and spend.</p>

    <p>While money itself is neutral, the Bible warns against loving it:</p>
    
    <blockquote>“For the love of money is the root of all evil” (1 Timothy 6:10).</blockquote>
    
    <p>It can easily become an idol, leading to anxiety, selfishness, and spiritual ruin.</p>
    
    <blockquote>“Money is a talent that God has entrusted to us to improve for His glory, not to hoard for selfish purposes” (<em>Testimonies for the Church</em>, Vol. 6, p. 367).</blockquote>

    <p>The Christian’s heart must be free from greed, trusting God’s provision instead.</p>

    <p>A vital part of stewardship is generous giving.</p>
    
    <blockquote>“God loveth a cheerful giver” (2 Corinthians 9:7).</blockquote>
    
    <p>Ellen White encouraged believers to:</p>
    
    <blockquote>“Pay their tithes and offerings promptly and liberally, that the work of God may advance” (<em>Testimonies for the Church</em>, Vol. 3, p. 383).</blockquote>

    <p>Giving is an act of worship and trust—an investment in eternal treasures, not just earthly wealth.</p>

    <p>Stewardship also involves wise budgeting, avoiding debt, and living within our means. The Bible advises prudence:</p>
    
    <blockquote>“Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise” (Proverbs 6:6).</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>“Godliness with contentment is great gain” (1 Timothy 6:6).</blockquote>
    
    <p>Ellen White taught that those who are faithful in small things, money included, are entrusted with greater responsibilities.</p>
    
    <blockquote>“He who is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much” (<em>Testimonies for the Church</em>, Vol. 4, p. 176).</blockquote>

    <p>Financial stewardship is a sacred responsibility that reflects our faith and priorities. By recognizing God’s ownership, avoiding the love of money, practicing generosity, and managing wisely, we honor Him with our resources.</p>
    
    <blockquote>“Faithful stewardship is a mark of true discipleship” (<em>Counsels on Stewardship</em>, p. 40).</blockquote>
    
    <p>Let us use our finances to advance God’s kingdom and reflect His character in all we do.</p>
