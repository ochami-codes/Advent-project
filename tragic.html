  <h2>The Last 24 Hours Before Christ’s Second Coming – A Tragic Testimony</h2>

  <p>The day before it happened, the sky was heavy and strange. The air itself felt charged, uneasy — as if the world were holding its breath. I had seen the signs before, heard the warnings from faithful friends and preachers. Many times, conviction had stirred my heart, but I had always told myself there was still time — time to change, to pray, to surrender. But time, I learned too late, is not always guaranteed.</p>

  <p>That evening, the world was in chaos. The plagues had devastated nations, and fear was everywhere. People ran to and fro, blaming one another, crying for help that never came. Deep inside, a dreadful realization was growing — that the Spirit of God had departed from the earth. I tried to pray, but my words felt hollow. My heart, once so easily stirred by appeals of mercy, had grown cold. I remembered the words I had brushed aside:</p>
  <blockquote class="quote-bible">“The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.” (Jeremiah 8:20)</blockquote>

  <p>Through the night, flashes of lightning tore across the heavens. The earth groaned under the weight of its corruption. I heard shouts, cries, and curses. In that terrible hour, the wicked turned on one another, their unity shattered. I thought of the sermons I had once heard — how Ellen White wrote that when probation closes, “the cases of all are decided for life or death,” and that “there will be no more prayers of mercy offered for the guilty.”</p>
  <blockquote class="quote-sop">— The Great Controversy, p. 613</blockquote>

  <p>Then came a stillness — dreadful and deep. It was as if the very pulse of the world had stopped. I looked toward the east, and there — at first small as a cloud of light — something was approaching. A sound like the voice of many waters filled the air. Every living thing seemed to tremble. And then I saw Him.</p>

  <p><strong>Christ was coming.</strong></p>

  <p>I cannot describe that sight — glory so bright, so pure, that it cut through the soul like fire. The heavens rolled back as a scroll. The trumpet of God sounded, and the earth quaked violently. I saw graves burst open — the righteous rising in joy, their faces shining with light. But we — those left behind — shrank back in horror. The brightness that brought them life brought us terror. We knew then that we were lost.</p>

  <p>Desperation seized me. I cried out for mercy, but there was none to give. I tried to hide among the rocks, but there was no shelter from that gaze — the eyes of love I had once refused. The wicked all around me screamed:</p>
  <blockquote class="quote-bible">“Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne!” (Revelation 6:16)</blockquote>

  <p>But no rock could hide us. We saw what we might have been — what peace, what joy, what glory we had thrown away. As I looked up, I saw the redeemed rising — men and women I had mocked, dismissed, or ignored. Their faces glowed with victory. They were meeting the Lord in the air, clothed in white robes. I stretched out my hands in vain. The gulf between us was fixed forever. I could only watch as light and song filled the heavens, while darkness and despair consumed the earth.</p>

  <p>Then the words I had once heard in warning echoed within me:</p>
  <blockquote class="quote-sop">“The sinner’s doom will be fixed eternally beyond all redemption.” — The Great Controversy, p. 614</blockquote>

  <p>I had believed there would always be another chance, another call. But now, as the glory faded from view and the cry of the lost filled the air, I knew — too late — that mercy’s day was past.</p>

  <p><strong>Christ had come — just as He said. But I was not ready.</strong></p>
