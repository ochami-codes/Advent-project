  <h2>Dating vs Courting – Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    As youth draw closer to the season of marriage, they are faced with a critical decision — the choice of a life partner. In the biblical sense, this process is called <strong>courtship</strong>. It is a prayerful, intentional, and guided approach to finding a spouse, rooted in godly principles and accountability.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, like many sacred things, Satan has crafted a near-perfect counterfeit — often known as <strong>dating</strong>. While the term may sound harmless, the principles that govern modern dating often lead down a path of emotional wounds, spiritual compromise, and moral downfall.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="sop">
    Satan is constantly seeking to lead the youth to follow worldly customs. He delights to see them rushing into courtship or marriage without seeking the counsel of God or godly parents.
  </blockquote>
  <span class="ref">— Adventist Home, p. 79</span>

  <p>
    The tragedy is that many of God’s children have abandoned the pure principles of biblical courtship, choosing instead to follow worldly patterns that offer short-term thrills but long-term regret.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="bible">
    Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
  </blockquote>
  <span class="ref">— Romans 12:2 (KJV)</span>

  <p>
    Our prayer is that through this study, your heart will be enlightened with heaven’s perspective on relationships, and that you'll gain practical wisdom to walk in God's perfect will regarding your future home.
