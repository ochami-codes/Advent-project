    <p>
      Technological advancement is amazing! Just think about the evolution of computers—from room-sized machines to sleek devices in our pockets. And now, here comes the jaw-dropping marvel of <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To man, God has granted incredible wisdom. Every breakthrough, every innovation, reflects something divine—our Creator's own creativity mirrored in humanity.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="verse">
      "So God created man in His own image..." — <strong>Genesis 1:27</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      But as with every divine gift, the enemy of souls seeks to pervert it. Satan is not sleeping. The devil has hijacked AI and other technologies to further his evil designs. From <strong>deepfake pornography</strong>, <strong>illicit content generation</strong>, and <strong>AI-assisted deception</strong>, to <strong>sex robots</strong> that degrade God’s sacred design for sexuality—this is a digital Babylon!
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      “The prince of darkness, who has long bent the powers of his mastermind to the work of deception, is now using every possible device to keep men bound by the chains of ignorance, sin, and self-indulgence.”<br>
      — <em>The Great Controversy, p. 519</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      While the world plunges deeper into technological depravity, <strong>where are God’s people?</strong> Are the children of this world wiser than the children of light?
    </p>

    <blockquote class="verse">
      "The children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light." — <strong>Luke 16:8</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      We must use AI and tech to spread the gospel like wildfire! What if AI is the “end-time technology” God foresaw would help take the <strong>Three Angels’ Messages</strong> to “every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people”?
    </p>

    <blockquote class="verse">
      “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth…” — <strong>Revelation 14:6</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      “It is God’s design that the spiritual and the practical shall be combined in the work of the Lord. Truth is to be brought into the practical life.”<br>
      — <em>Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 6, p. 110</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      That means learning web development, app design, AI engineering, data science, and more—not just for career growth, but for kingdom service. God is calling for digital missionaries. Tech-savvy Josephs. Spirit-filled Daniels in the IT field. Youths and adults alike who will redeem tech for God’s glory.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      “With such an army of workers as our youth, rightly trained, might furnish, how soon the message of a crucified, risen, and soon-coming Saviour might be carried to the whole world!”<br>
      — <em>Education, p. 271</em>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      AI is not just for Silicon Valley. It's for <strong>Mount Zion</strong>. God needs developers. He needs designers. He needs sanctified engineers and tech pioneers who will carry the everlasting gospel in a world wired for deception.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don’t be left behind. <strong>Learn. Build. Evangelize.</strong> Time is short—and your digital talents were given for <em>such a time as this</em>.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="verse">
      “...and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” — <strong>Esther 4:14</strong>
