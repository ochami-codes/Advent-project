    <h1>Unfaithful Partner In Courtship?</h1>
  </div>

  <!-- Main Content -->
  <main>
    <p>Most unfaithful partners in modern marriages can retrace their uncouth behavior from the courtship stage. If your partner cheats on you and you’re not yet married, how will it be when you are joined to them with the marriage vow? Do you think marriage will suddenly transform them? Courtship is the testing ground of character. If betrayal, dishonesty, and infidelity manifest before marriage, it is a warning sign from heaven that should not be ignored.</p>

    <p>Marriage is a sacred covenant before God, not a magical remedy for sin. The Bible is clear:</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.
      <span class="ref">Luke 16:10</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>If someone cannot be faithful during courtship, what assurance is there that they will be faithful in the solemn bonds of marriage? God calls His children to purity, loyalty, and honesty in all relationships.</p>

    <blockquote class="sop">If those who are contemplating marriage are unconverted, let them not unite their destinies with each other. Let the question be asked seriously: Will this union help me heavenward? Will it increase my love for God? Will it enlarge my sphere of usefulness in this life?
      <span class="ref">Adventist Home, p. 44.2</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Infidelity before marriage is a sign of deeper issues of character. To remain in such a relationship in the hope that marriage will reform the person is to ignore God’s warnings and place your soul in danger.</p>

    <blockquote class="sop">The pure truth which sanctifies the soul will give you courage to cut yourself loose from the most pleasing acquaintance whom you know does not love and fear God, and knows nothing of the principles of true righteousness. We may always bear with a friend's infirmities and with his ignorance, but never with his vices.
      <span class="ref">Adventist Home, p. 47</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Sanctified common sense agrees: if a foundation is cracked, the building will not stand strong. Marriage does not erase flaws—it magnifies them. An unfaithful fiancé will likely be an unfaithful spouse. Rather than cling to false hope, the wise decision is to prayerfully step back, seek God’s guidance, and allow Him to lead you to a partner who reveres Him and values the sacredness of marriage.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Handling an unfaithful partner before marriage requires courage, discernment, and trust in God. The Bible counsels faithfulness, the Spirit of Prophecy warns against hasty and mismatched unions, and sanctified reasoning shows that marriage will not transform an unfaithful character. The safest path is to end such a relationship prayerfully, trusting that God has better plans for your life.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.
      <span class="ref">Jeremiah 29:11</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It is better to endure the temporary pain of separation than the lifelong anguish of being bound to a covenant-breaker.</p>
