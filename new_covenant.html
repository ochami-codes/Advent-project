                <h1>The Law in the New Covenant</h1>


<p>The new covenant is often misunderstood as a replacement for God’s law. But the Bible teaches that it deepens and internalizes the law, placing it in the heart rather than just on tablets of stone. Jesus is the Mediator of this better covenant, empowering us to obey from love.</p>


<h2>The Law to be Written in Our Hearts</h2>
<p><strong>Hebrews 8:10</strong> says, </p> 
<blockquote>“I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts.”</blockquote> 
<p>This new covenant is not a new set of rules, but a new relationship—a heart experience with God’s law. The problem wasn’t the law but the people’s hearts, which Christ now transforms.</p>

<p><strong>Jeremiah 31:33</strong> mirrors this promise, emphasizing God's desire to dwell with His people and write His will within them. The new covenant restores obedience through love, not legalism, and empowers us to walk in God’s ways from the inside out.</p>

<p>Ellen G. White explains in God’s Amazing Grace, p. 136:</p> 
<blockquote>“The same law that was engraved upon the tables of stone is written by the Holy Spirit upon the tables of the heart.”</blockquote> 
<p>The law remains unchanged, but the way it’s applied changes—through the power of Christ within.</p>

<p><strong>Romans 3:31</strong> affirms that faith does not cancel the law:</p> 
<blockquote>“Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.” 
</blockquote>
<p>Through Christ’s righteousness, the law becomes our guide, not our judge, and its requirements are fulfilled in us through the Holy Spirit.</p>


<h3>The New Covenant Magnifies the Law</h3>
<p>The new covenant does not abolish God’s law; it secures it more deeply in the heart of the believer. In Christ, we find both forgiveness for past disobedience and power to live a life of righteousness in harmony with God’s holy standard.</p>
