    <p>
      In today’s world, marriage trends seem to be shifting. We often hear of younger men marrying women much older than themselves—sometimes almost the age of their mothers. Likewise, young women are increasingly entering relationships with men old enough to be their grandfathers. This raises a serious question: <strong>Why is this happening, and is it in harmony with God’s plan for marriage?</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>God’s Order in Creation</h2>
    <p>
      The Bible reveals a clear sequence in the creation of man and woman.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
      <span class="ref">Genesis 2:7</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Afterward, God saw that it was not good for man to be alone, and He created a woman to be a helper suitable for him.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs… And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
      <span class="ref">Genesis 2:21–22</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
      <span class="ref">Genesis 2:23</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      From the beginning, man was created first and given responsibility, while woman was created as a helper suitable for him. Throughout Scripture, we find examples of men marrying women younger than themselves—Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob with Rachel and Leah.
    </p>

    <h2>Must a Man Be Older Than the Woman?</h2>
    <p>
      From both the creation account and biblical examples, it is evident that God’s design was for the man to be the leader, protector, and provider.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      God has assigned to man the work of guiding the house, and upon him rests the responsibility of both the temporal and the spiritual interests of his household.
      <span class="ref">Adventist Home, p. 215</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This does not mean that an exact age sequence is a rigid law. However, the principle of male leadership and maturity in marriage suggests that the man should ideally be older, both in age and responsibility.
    </p>

    <h2>What About Large Age Gaps?</h2>
    <p>
      The Spirit of Prophecy gives practical counsel concerning wide disparities in age:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      There should not be a great disparity in age. A neglect of this rule may result in seriously impairing the health of the younger. And often the children are robbed of physical and mental strength. They cannot receive from an aged parent the care and companionship which their young lives demand.
      <span class="ref">Adventist Home, p. 81.3</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      A very large age difference is unwise, not only for the couple but also for the children. A parent advanced in years may lack the strength, energy, and companionship that children need. A balanced and reasonable age gap—about two to ten years—is advisable.
    </p>

    <h2>The Influence of Worldly Trends</h2>
    <p>
      The increasing trend of young men marrying women much older, or young women marrying men much older, often reflects worldly motives such as wealth, social status, or fleeting attraction. The Bible warns:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
      <span class="ref">1 John 2:15</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Marriage is too sacred a union to be built on such superficial foundations.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Marriage is a sacred covenant designed by God. From creation, man was made first and given the role of leadership and protection, while woman was created as a helper suitable for him. In harmony with Scripture and the Spirit of Prophecy, a man should be older than the woman, though within reasonable limits. Extreme age disparities should be avoided, as they may impair the health and happiness of the family.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      Marriage affects the afterlife both in this world and in the world to come.
      <span class="ref">Adventist Home, p. 44</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      When entering marriage, let the guiding principles be <em>love, maturity, fitness for responsibility, and alignment with God’s order</em>—not worldly customs or fleeting attractions.
