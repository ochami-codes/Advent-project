      <h2>“I Never Knew You” — Does God Really Know You?</h2>

      <p>Lord, I was a <em>'mtumishi'</em>...<br>
      Lord, I was a <em>'reformer'</em>...<br>
      Lord, but I dressed <em>'modestly'</em>...<br>
      Lord, I kept the <em>'Sabbath'</em>...<br>
      Lord, I was a <em>'vegetarian'</em>...<br>
      Lord, I went for missions...<br>
      Lord, I returned tithe and paid offerings...</p>

      <p>Then the Lord will declare:</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        I never knew you: depart from Me, ye that work iniquity. (Matthew 7:23)
      </blockquote>

      <p>Yes, the Lord is aware that you exist—but does He <em>know</em> you?</p>

      <p>Is it possible that the One you call your Father does not know you? Is God your Father?—really?</p>

      <p>If He's not, then who is your father? Christ gives the answer:</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do... (John 8:44)
      </blockquote>

      <p>Is your father God—or the devil?</p>

      <p><strong>How do you know if you're God's child?</strong></p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His. (Romans 8:9)
      </blockquote>

      <p>If the Holy Spirit is not dwelling in you, then you don’t belong to Christ. You are not His. You belong to the enemy.</p>

      <p>Wondering if the Holy Spirit is in you? Here's how we receive Him:</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        And we are His witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey Him. (Acts 5:32)
      </blockquote>

      <p>If you're willfully ignoring or breaking any of God’s clear commands, you're living without the Holy Spirit—and that’s a dangerous place to be.</p>

      <h3>Where Is Our Hope?</h3>

      <p>How can we truly become sons and daughters of God? John tells us beautifully:</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name. (John 1:12)
      </blockquote>

      <p>Christ has made the way. Will you accept Him and become God’s child today?</p>

      <p>It's a privilege to be known and owned by God. Look at this wonderful assurance:</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
        The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:
        And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ... (Romans 8:15–17)
      </blockquote>

      <p><strong>Choose you this day whom you will serve—God or Satan?</strong></p>

      <p>The choice is yours. And remember: You have nothing to recommend yourself to God. It's by grace alone. Outward change without inner transformation is empty. God is looking for hearts fully surrendered.</p>

      <p>This is a dreadful sentence, yes—but it will be spoken:</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        I never knew you: depart from Me, ye that work iniquity. (Matthew 7:23)
      </blockquote>

      <p>May this not be your end.</p>
