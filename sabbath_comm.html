      <h1>The Sabbath in the Ten Commandments</h1>


<p>The Ten Commandments represent God’s eternal law of love and duty, given by His own voice and written by His own hand. Among these precepts, the fourth commandment stands out, not only because it begins with the word "Remember," but because it points directly to God as Creator and Lawgiver. The Sabbath commandment is the seal and centerpiece of the Decalogue, tying together worship, loyalty, and divine authority.
</p>

<h2>The Sabbath Commandment Identifies the Lawgiver</h2>
<p><strong>Exodus 20:8-11</strong> records the fourth commandment:</p>

<blockquote> “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God... For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth... and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.”
</blockquote>



<p>The command begins with the word “Remember,” indicating that it was already known before Sinai. It calls humanity back to the institution established at Creation <strong>(Genesis 2:2-3)</strong>. Unlike the other commandments which begin with “Thou shalt not,” the fourth is both a call to action (keep it holy) and a reminder of relationship, God as Creator and we as His creation.</p>

<p>The Sabbath commandment is the only one that identifies who the Lawgiver is, <em>“the Lord made heaven and earth.”</em> It includes His name (the Lord), His title (Creator), and His territory (heaven and earth). This makes it the seal of the Ten Commandments. Ellen White writes,
</p> 
<blockquote>“The fourth commandment is the only one of all the ten in which are found both the name and the title of the Lawgiver… It is the seal of God’s law” (Great Controversy, p. 452).
</blockquote>

<p>Some argue that the Ten Commandments were for the Jews only, but Scripture shows otherwise.
</p>
<blockquote> Isaiah 56:6-7 makes clear that “the sons of the stranger”
</blockquote>
<p>who keep the Sabbath are accepted by God. Furthermore, the law is described as <em>“the whole duty of man”</em> <strong>(Ecclesiastes 12:13)</strong>. Jesus confirmed the enduring authority of the law in <strong>Matthew 5:17-18</strong>, stating that not even a <em>“jot or tittle”</em> would pass away.</p>

<p>The fourth commandment also reveals God’s desire for a rhythm in life, six days of work and one day of rest. The Sabbath is not just about physical rest, but spiritual renewal.
</p>
<blockquote>“It was designed to bring men into communion with God,” says Ellen White in Desire of Ages, p. 281.
</blockquote> 
<p>It is a sacred appointment to remember who God is, what He has done, and who we are in relation to Him.
</p>

<p>Sadly, many have forgotten or rejected the Sabbath while claiming to honor the Ten Commandments. Yet <strong>James 2:10</strong> reminds us that
</p> <blockquote>“whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.”
</blockquote> 
<p>The fourth commandment is not optional; it is integral to God’s moral law, written not just on stone, but meant to be written in the heart <strong>(Hebrews 8:10).
</strong>
<h3>Sabbath is for All Humanity</h3>
<p>The Sabbath commandment in the Ten Commandments is a divine call to loyalty, worship, and remembrance of our Creator. It is not a Jewish tradition but a universal law given to humanity by God Himself. As Ellen White writes,
</p> 
<blockquote>“God placed His sanctity upon the seventh day. The Sabbath was not for Israel merely, but for the world” (Desire of Ages, p. 288)
</blockquote>.
<p>To remember the Sabbath is to acknowledge God's authority and His rightful place in our lives as Creator and Redeemer.
