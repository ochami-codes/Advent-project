          <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Ever wondered where your hard-earned money goes?</p>

  <p>You’ve got a decent job, a respectable salary, and good benefits — yet something always seems off. It’s as if your pockets have holes. You work long hours, invest in ventures, and toil year after year… but do you really have something to show for it? Sometimes, it feels like there’s an invisible whirlwind sweeping away all you gather.</p>

  <p>Could it be… a curse?</p>

  <p>As strange as that may sound, <strong>yes</strong>, there is such a thing — <strong>a divine curse that comes from neglecting the things of God</strong>. The Lord, through the prophet Haggai, warned the Israelites of this very danger:</p>

  <blockquote class="bible-quote">
    "Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways. Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes."  
    <span class="verse-ref">— Haggai 1:5–6 (KJV)</span>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Why did this happen to them? It was because they prioritized their own comfort while <strong>neglecting God’s house</strong>. The result? Drought, scarcity, and frustration.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>Does It Concern You?</h2>
  <p>The same principle applies today. The Lord asks:</p>

  <blockquote class="bible-quote">
    “Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.”  
    <span class="verse-ref">— Malachi 3:8 (KJV)</span>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It’s sobering to realize that <strong>withholding tithes and offerings is counted as robbery against God</strong>. And the consequence?</p>

  <blockquote class="bible-quote">
    “Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.”  
    <span class="verse-ref">— Malachi 3:9 (KJV)</span>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>But Why Tithes and Offerings? Does God Really Need My Money?</h2>

  <p>God owns everything.</p>

  <blockquote class="bible-quote">
    “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.”  
    <span class="verse-ref">— Psalm 24:1 (KJV)</span>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote class="bible-quote">
    “The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.”  
    <span class="verse-ref">— Haggai 2:8 (KJV)</span>
  </blockquote>

  <p>So, if He owns everything, why ask us to give?</p>

  <p><strong>Because giving isn’t for God’s benefit—it’s for ours.</strong></p>

  <blockquote class="bible-quote">
    “But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth…”  
    <span class="verse-ref">— Deuteronomy 8:18 (KJV)</span>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Everything we have is a loan from Heaven. <strong>We are stewards</strong> — and through faithful stewardship, God trains us to trust Him, be unselfish, and support His cause.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>The Work of God Needs Our Support</h2>

  <p>The tithe (a tenth of our increase) is <strong>holy</strong> and belongs to God. It is used to support ministers, missionaries, and the spread of the gospel. Offerings, on the other hand, are <strong>freewill gifts</strong> — used for church maintenance, evangelism, and relief efforts.</p>

  <blockquote class="sop-quote">
    “The Lord calls for His tithe to be brought into His storehouse for the sustenance of the gospel laborers, and He calls upon His people to make liberal offerings. Those who are truly converted will not withhold their means when there is a need.”  
    <span class="verse-ref">— Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 9, p. 249</span>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote class="sop-quote">
    “The Lord does not need our offerings. We cannot enrich Him by our gifts. Says the psalmist: ‘All things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee.’”  
    <span class="verse-ref">— Counsels on Stewardship, p. 18</span>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We give <strong>not because God lacks</strong> — but because <strong>His work on earth depends on faithful believers</strong>.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>Blessings or Curses — The Choice is Ours</h2>

  <blockquote class="bible-quote">
    “Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.”  
    <span class="verse-ref">— Malachi 3:10 (KJV)</span>
  </blockquote>

  <p>What a beautiful contrast! Instead of a curse, God offers <strong>abundant blessings</strong> when we faithfully return what belongs to Him.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion: Consider Your Ways</h2>

  <p>Are you experiencing financial struggles, frustration, or spiritual dryness? It may be time to, as Haggai said, <strong>“consider your ways.”</strong> Has the house of God been neglected while your own pursuits thrive?</p>

  <p>When we honor God with our tithes and offerings, we align ourselves with His divine order. We show that He is our Provider and that we trust Him. In return, He promises to bless and sustain us beyond what we could ever imagine.</p>

  <blockquote class="bible-quote">
    “Honor the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:  
    So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.”  
    <span class="verse-ref">— Proverbs 3:9–10 (KJV)</span>
