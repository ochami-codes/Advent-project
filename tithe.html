    <h1>Tithes and Offerings: A Divine Key to Blessings and Restoration</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Based on Haggai 1:5–11</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Ever wondered where your hard-earned money goes?</p>
      <p>You’ve got a decent job, a respectable salary, and good benefits — yet something always seems off. It’s as if your pockets have holes. You work hard, invest wisely, and toil year after year... but do you really have something to show for it?</p>
      <p>Could it be... a curse?</p>
      <p><strong>Yes.</strong> According to Scripture, a divine curse can result from neglecting the things of God. Through the prophet Haggai, the Lord rebuked His people:</p>

      <blockquote class="bible-quote">
        "Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways. Ye have sown much, and bring in little... he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes."  
        <span class="verse-ref">— Haggai 1:5–6 (KJV)</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Why? Because they focused on themselves while <strong>neglecting God’s house</strong>. The result was drought, scarcity, and frustration.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Does It Concern You?</h2>
      <p>This principle still applies today. God asks:</p>

      <blockquote class="bible-quote">
        “Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me... In tithes and offerings.”  
        <span class="verse-ref">— Malachi 3:8 (KJV)</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Withholding tithes and offerings is considered robbery—and the result?</p>

      <blockquote class="bible-quote">
        “Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.”  
        <span class="verse-ref">— Malachi 3:9 (KJV)</span>
      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Tithes and Offerings? Does God Really Need Our Money?</h2>
      <p>God owns everything:</p>

      <blockquote class="bible-quote">
        “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof...”  
        <span class="verse-ref">— Psalm 24:1 (KJV)</span>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="bible-quote">
        “The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.”  
        <span class="verse-ref">— Haggai 2:8 (KJV)</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p>So why give? Because <strong>giving is for our benefit</strong>—not God's.</p>

      <blockquote class="bible-quote">
        “But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth…”  
        <span class="verse-ref">— Deuteronomy 8:18 (KJV)</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Everything we have is from Him. Through stewardship, we learn trust, generosity, and obedience.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Work of God Needs Our Support</h2>
      <p>The tithe—a tenth—belongs to God and supports gospel workers. Offerings, given freely, support evangelism, maintenance, and humanitarian needs.</p>

      <blockquote class="sop-quote">
        “The Lord calls for His tithe to be brought into His storehouse... Those who are truly converted will not withhold their means when there is a need.”  
        <span class="verse-ref">— Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 9, p. 249</span>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="sop-quote">
        “The Lord does not need our offerings... ‘All things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee.’”  
        <span class="verse-ref">— Counsels on Stewardship, p. 18</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p>We give not because God lacks, but because His mission relies on willing hearts and hands.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Blessings or Curses — The Choice is Ours</h2>

      <blockquote class="bible-quote">
        “Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse... and prove me now herewith... if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing...”  
        <span class="verse-ref">— Malachi 3:10 (KJV)</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Instead of a curse, God promises overflowing blessings to the faithful giver.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion: Consider Your Ways</h2>
      <p>Are you facing financial or spiritual dryness? Perhaps it's time to heed Haggai’s counsel: <strong>"Consider your ways."</strong></p>

      <p>When we honor God through faithful giving, we show trust in Him—and He honors us with His providence.</p>

      <blockquote class="bible-quote">
        “Honor the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:  
        So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.”  
        <span class="verse-ref">— Proverbs 3:9–10 (KJV)</span>
