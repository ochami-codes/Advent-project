    <h1>Who Should I Court?</h1>
  </div>

  <main>
    <p>The world has set strange standards in matters concerning choice of life partners.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Does he have money?</li>
      <li>Is she beautiful and physically appealing?</li>
      <li>Does he follow a modern fashion and lifestyle?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      All these and many other senseless things are considered while setting aside matters such as character development and Christian maturity. But we must ask the real questions:
      What should a man look for in a woman he is to marry? What should a woman look for in a man she intends to join herself to?
    </p>

    <p>
      As a matter of fact, relationships should picture—even if not perfectly—the relationship Christ has with His church. Just as Christ gave Himself up for the church, so must love in a Christian relationship be selfless, pure, and based on principle rather than passion alone.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her, that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word...
      <span class="ref">Ephesians 5:25–27</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>1. Courtship Is Not a Game</h2>
    <p>
      God has never left His children to grope in darkness regarding relationships. Courtship, in His design, is not for flirtation, experimentation, or self-gratification. It's a sacred step in the journey toward building a godly home. The heart should never be given away lightly.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      Few have correct views of the marriage relation. They make light of this important step… It is a matter that is to last through time and eternity.
      <span class="ref">Adventist Home, p. 44</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The decision of whom to court must be prayerful and Spirit-led, not emotion-driven. Our feelings must be submitted to God's will.</p>

    <h2>2. Character Above All</h2>
    <p>
      Beauty fades, wealth can vanish, but character endures. A godly man should look for a woman who fears God, loves truth, and exhibits the fruit of the Spirit. A godly woman should seek a man who is spiritually grounded, humble, and committed to leading in righteousness.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, but a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised.
      <span class="ref">Proverbs 31:30</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness?
      <span class="ref">2 Corinthians 6:14</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A life partner should help you draw closer to God, not pull you from Him.</p>

    <h2>3. Look for Spiritual Compatibility</h2>
    <p>
      It’s not enough to simply be “in the church.” True compatibility is based on shared convictions, spiritual vision, and an agreement on life purpose. Two cannot walk together unless they are agreed.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?
      <span class="ref">Amos 3:3</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      Before giving her hand in marriage, every woman should inquire whether he with whom she is to unite her destiny is worthy.
      <span class="ref">Adventist Home, p. 47</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The same goes for men. Ask: <em>Will this person be a help or a hindrance in my walk with Christ and in my mission?</em>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Pray and Wait on God</h2>
    <p>
      God, who brought Eve to Adam, is still in the business of writing love stories—when we let Him. Don't rush. Do not settle. Seek counsel. Wait on the Lord.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.
      <span class="ref">Proverbs 3:6</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Delight yourself also in the Lord, and He shall give you the desires of your heart.
      <span class="ref">Psalm 37:4</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Many who have rushed into courtship based on feelings alone have ended up in years of misery. But those who waited upon the Lord found peace, joy, and purpose in their homes.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Who should you court? Not the richest, the most beautiful, or the most charming person. But one who walks with God, respects His Word, and will love you with a self-sacrificing, Christlike love. The best courtship begins with friendship, blossoms in purity, and ends in a Christ-centered union.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      Make Christ first and last and best in everything.
