    <h1>Polygamy: God’s Allowance Is Not His Will</h1>
  </header>

  <!-- Main Content -->
  <main>
    <p>
      One of the common arguments raised in favor of polygamy is that some of the greatest figures in the Bible had multiple wives. 
      People quickly point to Solomon with his one thousand wives, David with his many wives, and even Abraham—the father of the faithful—who had more than one wife. 
      Almost all the patriarchs seemed to have lived in polygamous settings. But does the existence of these examples mean that polygamy is God’s will for His people?
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is this: <strong>when God allows something, it does not mean He approves of it.</strong> 
      There are many things in the world that God permits because of human stubbornness and freedom of choice, but they are still contrary to His perfect will.
    </p>

    <h2>God’s Original Plan</h2>
    <p>
      From the beginning, God’s blueprint for marriage was clear: one man, one woman, joined for life. 
      In Eden, before sin entered, God created Adam and gave him one wife, Eve.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="bible">
      Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
      <span class="ref">Genesis 2:24</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Jesus Himself reaffirmed this Edenic model when questioned about marriage:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="bible">
      But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female. 
      For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; 
      And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh. 
      What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
      <span class="ref">Mark 10:6–9</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Notice—two shall be one, not three, four, or more.
    </p>

    <h2>Polygamy in Bible History</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, Abraham, Jacob, David, and Solomon had multiple wives. But each case records sorrow, rivalry, and brokenness as the fruit of departing from God’s design:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Abraham</strong>: The introduction of Hagar led to jealousy, strife, and bitterness between Sarah and Hagar (Genesis 16).</li>
      <li><strong>Jacob</strong>: His marriages to Leah and Rachel, and later their handmaids, bred envy, competition, and a divided household (Genesis 29–30).</li>
      <li><strong>David</strong>: His many wives contributed to family disorder, rebellion, and tragic events among his children (2 Samuel 13–18).</li>
      <li><strong>Solomon</strong>: His marriages to heathen women drew his heart away from God and led Israel into idolatry (1 Kings 11:1–4).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Every biblical record of polygamy shows not blessing, but sorrow.
    </p>

    <h2>God’s Tolerance vs. God’s Will</h2>
    <p>
      The fact that God did not immediately punish these patriarchs for polygamy does not mean He approved of it. 
      Instead, in His mercy, He bore long with their weakness—just as He does with sinners today.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="bible">
      And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent.
      <span class="ref">Acts 17:30</span>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="sop">
      Polygamy had become so widespread that it had ceased to be regarded as a sin; but it was no less a violation of the law of God, 
      and was fatal to the sacredness and peace of the family relation.
      <span class="ref">Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 145</span>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="sop">
      The Lord did not sanction polygamy in a single instance. It was contrary to His will. 
      He permitted it, but it was always a source of unhappiness and strife. 
      It was not only contrary to His will, but productive of the most evil results.
      <span class="ref">Spiritual Gifts, Vol. 3, p. 99</span>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="sop">
      Polygamy, which had been early introduced, contrary to the divine arrangement, 
      gradually led to the most oppressive and degrading forms of slavery.
      <span class="ref">The Spirit of Prophecy, Vol. 1, p. 93</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Christ’s Restoration of Marriage</h2>
    <p>
      Jesus came to restore the Edenic ideal. Just as He lifted the Sabbath above the traditions of men, 
      He also lifted marriage back to God’s perfect plan. 
      He made it clear that Moses only allowed divorce (and by extension, tolerated polygamy) because of the hardness of men’s hearts—not because it was God’s will.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="bible">
      Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.
      <span class="ref">Matthew 19:8</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Polygamy is one of those things God permitted in Bible times but never sanctioned. 
      The Scriptures and the Spirit of Prophecy agree—it was never His plan. 
      Instead of blessing, it brought sorrow, rivalry, and ruin. 
      God’s true plan is clear: one man, one woman, joined in holy covenant for life, reflecting Christ’s love for His church.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="bible">
      Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it.
      <span class="ref">Ephesians 5:25</span>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="sop">
      God celebrated the first marriage. Thus the institution has for its originator the Creator of the universe. 
      … Christ honored the marriage relation by making it also a symbol of the union between Himself and His redeemed ones.
      <span class="ref">Adventist Home, p. 25</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Anything less than this is a departure from the divine blueprint.
