         <h1>The Sabbath and the Apostles</h1>


<p>After Jesus’ resurrection and ascension, many wonder if the apostles continued to keep the seventh-day Sabbath or if they shifted to worship on Sunday. The book of Acts and the epistles offer clear evidence that the apostles, both Jewish and Gentile believers, upheld the Sabbath as a day of worship, teaching, and fellowship. Their example affirms the Sabbath’s permanence in the life of the New Testament church.</p>

<h2>The Disciples Kept the Sabbath</h2>
<p>One of the clearest demonstrations of the apostles keeping the Sabbath is found in <strong>Acts 13:14</strong>. Paul and his companions <em>“went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.”</em> In the same chapter, verse 42 tells us that <em>“the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.”</em> If Paul had changed the day of worship, this would have been the perfect opportunity to introduce Sunday. But verse 44 says, <em>“And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.”</em>
</p>

<p>This practice wasn’t limited to Jews or synagogues. In <strong>Acts 16:13</strong>, Paul and others <em>“went out of the city by a riverside, where prayer was wont to be made,”</em> on the Sabbath. This gathering didn’t happen in a synagogue, proving that Sabbath worship extended beyond Jewish tradition. The apostles kept the Sabbath because it was still the day set apart by God, not due to cultural habit or ceremonial law.</p>

<p>In <strong>Acts 17:2</strong>, it is written,
</p> 
<blockquote>“And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures.”
</blockquote> 
<p>Paul’s “manner” or custom mirrored Christ’s <strong>(Luke 4:16)</strong>. Even after years of ministry among Gentiles, his practice of Sabbath worship remained unchanged. If a new day of worship had been instituted, it would have been clearly recorded in Scripture. But no such change is mentioned.
</p>

<p>Ellen White affirms the apostles’ consistent Sabbath observance. She writes,</p> 
<blockquote>“The apostles preached on the Sabbath, not only to the Jews, but to other nationalities” (The Acts of the Apostles, p. 232).</blockquote>
<p>The gospel was going to the Gentiles, yet the Sabbath remained God’s chosen day of rest and worship. Rather than changing it, the apostles taught others to honor it in the spirit of Christ.
</p>

<p>Moreover, no biblical text suggests that the first day of the week was now sacred or a replacement for the Sabbath. While the early church occasionally gathered on the first day (like in Acts 20:7), these instances were rare and not connected to the idea of a new Sabbath. Nowhere in the New Testament is Sunday ever called <em>“the Lord’s day.”</em> In contrast, Jesus said, <em>“The Son of Man is Lord even of the sabbath day” (Matthew 12:8)</em>, meaning the seventh day.
</p>

<h3>We should Follow Apostle's Footsteps</h3>
<p>The apostles, empowered by the Holy Spirit and guided by Christ’s teachings, continued to keep the seventh-day Sabbath after Jesus’ ascension. Their actions and teachings confirm the ongoing authority of the fourth commandment. As Ellen White notes,</p> 
<blockquote>“The Sabbath was as sacredly observed by Paul and his associates as it had been by Jesus” (Acts of the Apostles, p. 396).
</blockquote>
<p>The apostolic example stands as a testimony to all believers that God’s holy day remains unchanged and eternally relevant.</p>
