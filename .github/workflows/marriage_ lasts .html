    <h2>Marriage That Lasts</h2>
    <p><strong>Building a God-Centered Union That Endures Life's Storms</strong></p>

    <p>Marriage was God's idea from the beginning—a sacred institution meant to bring joy, companionship, and spiritual growth. Yet in a world filled with broken relationships, how can couples ensure their marriage stands the test of time? A lasting marriage doesn’t just happen—it’s built intentionally on love, faith, mutual respect, and daily surrender to Christ.</p>

    <h3>Christ as the Foundation</h3>
    <p>A marriage built on Christ is like a house on solid rock. When trials come—and they will—it won’t crumble. Jesus must be more than a name in our vows; He must be the daily center of the relationship. Couples should pray together, study the Bible, and seek to reflect Christ's character in how they speak, forgive, and love.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible-quote">
      “Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it.” – Psalm 127:1
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="sop-quote">
      “The cause of division and discord in families and in the church is separation from Christ.” – Ellen G. White, <em>Adventist Home</em>, p. 179
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Love with Purpose, Not Just Passion</h3>
    <p>While romance and emotional connection are important, true love in marriage is deeper than fleeting feelings. It is a daily choice to be patient, kind, and selfless—even when it’s hard. Lasting love mirrors the love of Christ: sacrificial, enduring, and committed.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible-quote">
      “Love suffereth long, and is kind... beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.” – 1 Corinthians 13:4-7
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="sop-quote">
      “Love is a plant of heavenly growth, and it must be fostered and nourished.” – Ellen G. White, <em>Adventist Home</em>, p. 50
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Communication and Conflict Resolution</h3>
    <p>Every marriage will face disagreements, but what matters is how couples handle them. Open, honest, and respectful communication is key. Never let pride or silence become walls. Instead, pray before speaking, listen more than you talk, and seek peace over being “right.”</p>

    <blockquote class="bible-quote">
      “A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.” – Proverbs 15:1
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="sop-quote">
      “If pride and selfishness were laid aside, five minutes would remove most difficulties.” – Ellen G. White, <em>Early Writings</em>, p. 119
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Forgiveness: The Oil of Marriage</h3>
    <p>No one is perfect, and mistakes will happen. But unforgiveness is like poison to the marriage relationship. A lasting marriage requires a heart that is quick to forgive, just as God forgives us. Letting go of past hurts is a sign of strength, not weakness.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible-quote">
      “And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.” – Ephesians 4:32
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Growing Together Spiritually and Practically</h3>
    <p>Lasting couples grow together—spiritually, emotionally, and even in everyday life skills. They set shared goals, support each other’s growth, and remain united in their mission. Whether raising children, serving in ministry, or working through trials, they stay yoked to the same divine purpose.</p>

    <blockquote class="sop-quote">
      “Those who are united by the ties of Christian marriage have important responsibilities to each other, to their children, and to society.” – Ellen G. White, <em>Ministry of Healing</em>, p. 356
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Marriage is not just a contract—it’s a covenant. A lasting marriage doesn’t mean there are no problems; it means both partners keep choosing love and faithfulness through every season. By making Christ the center and leaning on His wisdom, your marriage can be a radiant testimony of God’s design for love that lasts.</p>
