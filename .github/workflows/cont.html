    <h1>The Great Controversy and End-time Conflict</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Whether you know it or not, we're involved in a great cosmic battle, between evil and good. Truth and error are in constant battle and we must choose which side to stand with. This great controversy began a way back in heaven when a created being, Lucifer, decided to rebel against his Maker and became Satan. The controversy will end with Satan on his knees — which side will you choose? Our daily lives and the choices we make show which side we're standing on.</p>

      <h2>God Has Never Lost a Battle</h2>
      <p>This world is not just in chaos, it’s in a cosmic war. From Eden to today, the battle between Christ and Satan continues. But we know how the story ends.</p>

      <p>Revelation reveals a final showdown: a conflict between truth and error, loyalty and rebellion. God's law, especially the Sabbath, will be at the heart of the issue. The faithful will be tested, but the Lamb will have His people who</p>

      <blockquote>“keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus” (Revelation 14:12).</blockquote>

      <p>Ellen White solemnly warns:</p>
      <blockquote>“The final movements will be rapid ones... the agencies of evil are combining their forces, and consolidating. They are strengthening for the last great crisis.” (Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 9, p. 11)</blockquote>

      <p>We must stand firm, rooted in the Word, clothed with Christ’s righteousness, and led by His Spirit. The controversy is real, but so is the victory that awaits.</p>
