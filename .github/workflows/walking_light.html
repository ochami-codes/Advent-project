      <h2>Walking in the Light</h2>

      <p>To walk in the light means to live in harmony with the truth that God has revealed to us. In a world shrouded in darkness and confusion, God's people are called to reflect His character and walk in His ways. Light, in the biblical sense, represents truth, purity, and the presence of God.</p>

      <div class="quote-bible"> 
        📖 “This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.” — 1 John 1:5-6
      </div>

      <p>Walking in the light is not merely about having knowledge of truth but living it daily. It's about aligning our actions with God's revealed will. As Jesus said, "I am the light of the world." When we walk in His light, we become reflectors of that same light to others. This walk brings peace, joy, and power over sin because it connects us directly with Christ, our source of righteousness.</p>

      <div class="quote-sop"> 
        📚 “It is not enough to have a knowledge of the truth. We must walk in the light. The truth must be brought into the inner sanctuary of the soul. It must be woven into the character.” — *Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 535*
      </div>

      <p>To walk in the light also implies growth. The path of the just is as a shining light that grows brighter and brighter (Proverbs 4:18). As the Spirit of God continues to enlighten our minds, we are expected to follow the truth wherever it leads, even when it challenges our comfort zones. A genuine walk in the light is characterized by humility, obedience, and a growing likeness to Christ.</p>

        📖 “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” — Psalm 119:105
      </div>

      <p>The more we walk in the light, the more aware we become of sin and our need for Christ’s cleansing power. But this is not a discouragement—it’s an invitation to deeper fellowship and transformation. Jesus is faithful to cleanse us and empower us to walk victoriously in His righteousness.</p>

        📚 “The closer you come to Jesus, the more faulty you will appear in your own eyes; for your vision will be clearer, and your imperfections will be seen in broad and distinct contrast to His perfect nature.” — *Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 64*
      </div>

      <p>Beloved, let us not be content with a theoretical faith. Let us daily seek Christ, study His Word, and surrender to His Spirit. The world needs the light that only Christ in us can offer. May we walk in the light as He is in the light, that we may have fellowship with one another and be prepared for His soon return.</p>

      <div class="quote-bible"> 
        📖 “But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.” — 1 John 1:7
