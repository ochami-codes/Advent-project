          <h1>The Sabbath and Jesus Christ</h1>


<p>Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is central to our salvation and the perfect example for Christian living. His relationship with the Sabbath reveals how this sacred day should be viewed and kept in the Christian era. Rather than abolishing the Sabbath, Jesus honored it with His presence, teaching, healing, and faithful observance. A close look at Christ's life shows that the Sabbath is a delight, not a burden, a day meant to do good, glorify God, and refresh the soul.
</p>

<h2>Jesus Kept the Sabbath</h2>
<p>Jesus was a Sabbath-keeper throughout His earthly ministry. <strong>Luke 4:16</strong> records,
</p> 
<blockquote>“And as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.”
</blockquote> 
<p>This reveals that Jesus had a consistent practice of worshiping on the seventh day. He kept the Sabbath not merely out of tradition but as an expression of obedience and love for His Father’s commandments (John 15:10).</p>

<p>More than just keeping the Sabbath, Jesus elevated its meaning. When the Pharisees criticized Him for healing on the Sabbath, Jesus responded, <em>“It is lawful to do well on the sabbath days” </em><strong>(Matthew 12:12)</strong>. The Sabbath was never meant to be a day of cold legalism, but of mercy, restoration, and communion with God. Ellen White writes,
</p> 
<blockquote>“The Sabbath… was made for man’s benefit. He needed to lay aside his own interests and pursuits for one day, that he might more fully contemplate the works of God” (The Desire of Ages, p. 286).
</blockquote>

<p>In <strong>Mark 2:27-28</strong>, Jesus made a profound statement:
</p> 
<blockquote>“The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath: Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.”
</blockquote>
<p>This affirms two key truths: (1) the Sabbath was made for all mankind, not just for Jews, and (2) Jesus, as Lord of the Sabbath, has authority over it. He never abolished it; He demonstrated how to properly honor it.</p>

<p>Some may ask: didn’t Jesus come to fulfill the law, thereby ending the Sabbath? But Jesus Himself clarified this in <strong>Matthew 5:17</strong>: 
<blockquote>“Think not that I am come to destroy the law… I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.”
</blockquote> 
<p>To “fulfil” means to live out, to give full meaning—not to cancel. Ellen White comments,
</p> 
<blockquote>“He came to magnify the law and make it honorable” (Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 48).
</blockquote>

<p>Even in His death, Jesus honored the Sabbath. After He died on the cross on Friday (the preparation day), He rested in the tomb on the Sabbath. <strong>Luke 23:56</strong> says of His followers,</p>
<blockquote>“And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.” 
</blockquote>
<p>His resurrection occurred on the first day of the week, but this did not alter or transfer the holiness of the seventh day.
</p>

<h3>We should Follow His Footsteps</h3>
<p>Jesus’ life and teachings confirm the continued validity and blessing of the seventh-day Sabbath. He is our perfect Example, and as Lord of the Sabbath, He calls us to follow Him in both worship and rest on the day He sanctified. Ellen White beautifully writes,
</p> 

<blockquote>“Jesus honored the Sabbath. He taught that it was to be a blessing to man and an institution of mercy” (The Desire of Ages, p. 206).
</blockquote> 
<p>As followers of Christ, we honor Him not only by calling Him Lord but by walking as He walked, including in Sabbath observance.</p>
