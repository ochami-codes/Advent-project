    <h1>The Law at Sinai</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        The giving of the Law at Mount Sinai stands as one of the most solemn moments in the history of God's dealings with humanity. It was more than a set of moral guidelines; it was a direct revelation of God's will, spoken by His own voice, demonstrating His authority, holiness, and love.
      </p>

      <h3>God's Law Spoken by His Own Voice</h3>
      <p>
        When God descended upon Mount Sinai in thunder, lightning, and a thick cloud <strong>(Exodus 19:16–18)</strong>, He spoke the Ten Commandments directly to the people <strong>(Exodus 20:1–17).</strong> Ellen White writes in <strong>Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 33,</strong> </p>
        <blockquote>“The law of God, spoken by His own voice, is a transcript of His character.”</blockquote>

      <h3>The Law as a Revelation of God's Will</h3>
      <p>
        Christ summarized the law as love to God and love to man <strong>(Matthew 22:37–40)</strong>. Ellen White adds in <strong>Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 109, </strong> </p>
        
        <blockquote>“The law reveals to man his sins, but it provides no remedy.”</blockquote>

      <h3>The Law’s Binding Authority for All Generations</h3>
     
     <p>In <strong>Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 305</strong>, Ellen White writes,</p> 
     <blockquote>“The law of God existed before man was created...”</blockquote>
       <p>Sinai was a reaffirmation of eternal principles. God’s law remains the standard today <strong>(Ecclesiastes 12:13–14; James 2:12).</strong>
      </p>

     <h2>The Law is God's Perfect Will</h2>
      <p>
        The Law at Sinai was more than a historical moment—it was the divine declaration of God’s perfect will. It points us to Christ, who fulfilled the law and empowers us to live it out through His Spirit. </p>
