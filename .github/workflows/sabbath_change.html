          <h1>The Change of the Sabbath</h1>


<p>The seventh-day Sabbath, instituted at creation and upheld throughout the Bible, has remained unchanged in Scripture. Yet, the majority of the Christian world now observes Sunday as a day of worship. This raises a critical question: who changed the Sabbath, and by what authority? A careful study of history and prophecy reveals that the change did not come from Christ or His apostles but through a gradual apostasy in the early church, prophesied in both the Bible and confirmed in historical records.</p>

<h2>The Beast Power did It</h2>
<p>The Bible foretold that a power would attempt to change God’s law.</p> 
<blockquote>Daniel 7:25 warns, “And he shall speak great words against the most High… and think to change times and laws.”
</blockquote> 
<p>This symbolic “little horn”  power represents a religious system that would rise after the fall of pagan Rome. It would exalt itself above God, persecute the saints, and tamper with His law, particularly the Sabbath commandment, which deals with both time and divine authority.
</p>

<p>Jesus and the apostles never sanctioned a change from Sabbath to Sunday. In fact, Jesus said,
</p> 
<blockquote>“Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law” (Matthew 5:18).
</blockquote> 
<p>Sunday worship did not originate from the Bible but from gradual compromises with pagan practices in the early centuries of Christianity. As Christianity spread within the Roman Empire, efforts were made to distinguish it from Judaism, and Sunday (the day pagans worshiped the sun god) began to be honored.</p>

<p>Historical sources confirm this. The Convert’s Catechism of Catholic Doctrine says,
</p> 
<blockquote>“Q. Which is the Sabbath day? A. Saturday is the Sabbath day. Q. Why do we observe Sunday instead of Saturday? A. Because the Catholic Church transferred the solemnity from Saturday to Sunday.”
</blockquote> 
<p>This admission shows that the change was made by ecclesiastical authority, not Scripture.
</p>

<p>Ellen White warns about this apostasy:
</p> 
<blockquote>“The archdeceiver had not completed his work. He was resolved to gather the Christian world under his banner and to exercise his power through his vicegerent, the proud pontiff who claimed to be the representative of Christ” (The Great Controversy, p. 51).
</blockquote>
<p>The Sunday institution became a mark of papal authority, an attempt to assert human tradition over divine command.</p>

<p>Revelation 13 and 14 echo this theme with warnings against worshiping the beast and receiving his mark. Central to the end-time controversy is worship; who we worship, how, and when. God’s call is to return to true worship:
</p> 
<blockquote>“Worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters” (Revelation 14:7).
</blockquote> 
<p>This language is a direct reference to the fourth commandment in Exodus 20:11, which identifies the Sabbath as a sign of the Creator.
</p>

<h3>Sunday Sacredness is an Invention of Man</h3>
<p>The change of the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday did not come from Christ or the Bible but through a gradual and deliberate shift led by the Roman Church. This change was foretold in prophecy and confirmed by history. God is calling His people to return to the original day of worship, His holy Sabbath. Ellen White states,
</p> 
<blockquote>“In the last days… the Sabbath test will be the great test of loyalty” (Great Controversy, p. 605).
</blockquote> <p>Let us choose to honor God by keeping His commandment rather than following the traditions of men.
