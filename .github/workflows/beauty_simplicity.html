      <h2>The Beauty of Simplicity</h2>

      <p>In a world obsessed with more—more possessions, more recognition, more complexity—God calls us to a life of beautiful simplicity. Simplicity is not about lack, but about clarity, focus, and freedom. It is the way of Christ, who lived humbly, walked simply, and taught profoundly with few words.</p>

      <div class="quote-bible"> 
        📖 “But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.” — 1 Timothy 6:6–7
      </div>

      <p>The life of Christ was marked by simplicity. He had no palace, no wealth, no political power—yet He possessed the peace and joy this world cannot give. His simple life was full of divine richness. In walking closely with the Father, He showed us that fulfillment is not found in abundance but in surrender and purpose.</p>

        📚 “It is the simplicity of the truth that makes it of value. The more simple the education in the home school, the more free from artificial display and the customs and habits of fashionable life, the more easily can the children be instructed in the principles of truth.” — *Ellen G. White, Child Guidance, p. 232*
      </div>

      <p>True simplicity is intentional. It means choosing what matters most—God, family, integrity, service. It’s about aligning our lives with heaven’s priorities, trimming off the unnecessary so our hearts are free to focus on eternal realities. In simplicity, there is peace. In simplicity, there is strength. In simplicity, there is beauty.</p>

      <div class="quote-bible"> 
        📖 “Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.” — Hebrews 13:5
      </div>

      <p>Simplicity not only blesses us personally, but it also testifies of Christ. When the world sees believers who are not swept away by consumerism, who live with joy and peace despite having little, they are drawn to the Source of that contentment. Simplicity glorifies God because it shows that He is enough.</p>

      <div class="quote-sop"> 
        📚 “Christ came to this world to show that by receiving power from on high, man can live an unsullied life. With unwearying patience and sympathetic helpfulness, He met men in their necessities, not to gratify curiosity, but to inspire faith. He could have opened the mysteries of science, but He did not. He said nothing to gratify curiosity or satisfy man’s ambition by opening the secrets of the universe. He spoke of the simplest truths, yet clothed them with power and beauty.” — *Ellen G. White, Ministry of Healing, p. 453*
      </div>

      <p>Let us choose the beauty of simplicity. Let our homes, our words, our wardrobes, and our ministries reflect heaven’s values. Let us, like Jesus, find joy in the humble path, the quiet life, and the still voice of God that speaks in simple ways to the listening soul.</p>
