      <h2>Undue Familiarity — A Subtle Snare</h2>

      <p>Needless emotional attachments…</p>
      <p>Careless flirting…</p>
      <p>Encroached personal boundaries and space…</p>
      <p>Casual hugging, long night calls without real purpose, endless gifts given without reason…</p>

      <p>These things might seem harmless to the world, but to the consecrated child of God, they are spiritual landmines. The Lord’s servant calls this <strong>undue familiarity</strong>. Shouldn’t God’s professed people maintain a high reserve?</p>

      <p>Isn’t the name of the LORD tarnished when those who carry His name trifle with souls emotionally?</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-sop">
        “All frivolity, all undue attention of men and women, must be condemned and discontinued. Some, even married men, who have indulged in this trifling familiarity, have endeavored to excuse themselves and escape censure by claiming that they have done no moral wrong. Was it no moral wrong to jest, joke, and pay flattering attentions to young women? Are you not starting in their minds a train of thought which it is impossible for you to change? Do you not by your levity and coquetry, sanction such conduct?” <br>
        <cite>(Testimonies on Sexual Behavior, Adultery, and Divorce, p. 245.3)</cite>

      <p><strong>Men, take heed:</strong></p>

      <blockquote class="quote-sop">
        “The Result of Undue Familiarity—There is an animal that strikes the arm with feebleness the moment it touches it. The muscles become as if paralyzed. In a similar way will it be with you spiritually, if your thoughts are allowed to run in a certain channel, and you give attention and preferences to young girls or married women. All this familiarity is death to spirituality.” <br>
        <cite>(TSB 162.2)</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>And to the godly woman seeking to remain pure in heart and life:</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-sop">
        “A woman who will allow an unchaste word or hint to be uttered in her presence is not as God would have her; one that will permit any undue familiarity or impure suggestion does not preserve her godlike womanhood.” <br>
        <cite>(Adventist Home, p. 333.5)</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Beloved, undue familiarity is silently eroding the spiritual strength of Christian youth. It’s death wrapped in harmless appearances. It’s friendliness with a trap beneath.</p>

      <p>May we be filled with God’s Spirit and courage to draw clear lines. May we honor God not just with doctrine, but also in our relationships and personal conduct.</p>
