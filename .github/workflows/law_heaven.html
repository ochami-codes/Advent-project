    <h1>The Law in Heaven Before Sin</h1>

    <section>
      <p>
        Before sin entered the universe, the law of God existed as the foundation of heaven’s government, reflecting His holy character of love, justice, and order. God's law is not an arbitrary set of rules but an expression of who He is. According to the Spirit of Prophecy,</p>
        <blockquote>“The law of God existed before man was created. The angels were governed by it. Satan fell because he transgressed the principles of God’s government. (The Signs of the Times, April 15, 1886).</blockquote>
        <p>This shows that the law was not made just for humans; it was already in place in heaven, ensuring harmony and peace among all created beings.</p>

      <h2>The Law of God is Eternal</h2>
      <p>
        The moral law, summarized in the Ten Commandments, is eternal in nature and spiritual in its essence. Though it was codified at Sinai for humanity, its principles are everlasting. Ellen White affirms,</p>
        <blockquote>“The law of God, being a revelation of His will, a transcript of His character, must forever endure, ‘as a faithful witness in heaven’”(Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, p. 48).</blockquote> <p>In heaven before sin, this law was not burdensome but a joy. The angels delighted in obeying God because they loved Him and one another. Their obedience flowed from willing hearts in harmony with God’s will.</p>
      </p>
      <p>
        Lucifer’s rebellion marked the first violation of this law. He desired to exalt himself above the law and thus above God, leading to the great controversy.</p> <blockquote>“There was war in heaven,” (Revelation 12:7)</blockquote> <p>not because the law was flawed, but because one creature chose self-exaltation over submission to divine authority. Ellen White writes,</p>
        <blockquote>“Satan... began to insinuate doubts concerning the laws that governed heavenly beings” (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 37).</blockquote> <p>His sin was lawlessness—rebellion against the order and love that the law represented. </p>
      <p>
        The existence of the law before sin highlights that God’s government is one of moral responsibility. Love, the very foundation of the law <strong>(Matthew 22:37-40)</strong>, reigned supreme in heaven. It governed not by force but through willing loyalty. The angels were free moral agents, and their obedience was evidence of their love for the Creator. As Ellen White notes,
        <blockquote>“Love is the agency which God uses to expel sin from the heart” (The Desire of Ages, p. 176).</blockquote>

      <h2>The Law was not Introduced After Sin </h2>
      <p>
        The law of God was not introduced after sin but was present in heaven from the beginning. It was the standard that preserved order, joy, and love among the heavenly beings. Its violation by Lucifer introduced sin, proving that any departure from God’s law brings destruction. As we seek to reflect the character of Christ, we too must honor and uphold that eternal law, for it is still the divine standard of righteousness, both in heaven and on earth.
