            <h1>The Plan of Redemption</h1>
            <section>
               <!--- <h2>Introduction</h2>-->
                <p>
                    Heaven was silent. No more songs of praise, sadness was written all over the face of angels. Now man has fallen into sin, what next? All knew the consequences of breaking God's law, it meant death. Will the edenic pair be left to perish under the guilt of their sin? All the angelic hosts and the unfallen worlds waited anxiously for the decree from the King of the Universe.

                <h2>God had the Plan</h2>
                   <p> Right there in the garden, while Adam and Eve trembled under the weight of guilt, God’s voice thundered not just in judgment, but in mercy:</p>
                   <blockquote> “I will put enmity between you and the woman... it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel” (Genesis 3:15).
                   </blockquote> </p>This was no idle threat to Satan it was the unveiling of God’s rescue plan.</p>

                      <p>Heaven had a plan even before sin arose. Christ, <em>“the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world” </em><strong>(Revelation 13:8)</strong>, had offered Himself as the Redeemer. He would enter the battlefield of sin, suffer its pain, and ultimately defeat it.</p>

                      <p>Ellen White writes,</p>
                <blockquote>“The instant man accepted the temptations of Satan, and did the very things God had said he should not do, Christ, the Son of God, stood between the living and the dead, saying, ‘Let the punishment fall on Me. I will stand in man's place.’”(Lift Him Up, p. 23)
                </blockquote>

                    <p>This plan revealed the depth of God’s love. He would not force obedience but win hearts through sacrifice. Redemption would cost heaven its most precious gift, but it would restore what sin had broken.</p>
