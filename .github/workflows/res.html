    <h1>The Resurrection and Ascension</h1>
    <section>
      
      <p>What do you think would have happened if Christ never rose from the dead? Would Christianity have been a meaningful religion? Would we have had any hope of overcoming sin? Just as His death was important to us, so is His resurrection and ascension. His resurrection gives us an assurance of final victory over sin and death.</p>

      <h2>His Resurrection is Our Assurance</h2>
      <p>If Calvary was the price, then the resurrection was the receipt—proof that Christ’s sacrifice was accepted by heaven.</p> <blockquote>“He is not here: for He is risen, as He said" (Matthew 28:6).</blockquote> </p>No power could hold the Prince of Life in the tomb!</p>

      <p>The resurrection is heaven’s stamp of assurance that sin, death, and the grave are defeated. Paul declares,</p> <blockquote>“If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins” (1 Corinthians 15:17).</blockquote> <p>But Christ is risen, and because He lives, we too shall live.</p>

      <p>Forty days after His resurrection, Christ ascended into heaven. There, before the gaze of His disciples, He was taken up into glory, and angels proclaimed that</p> <blockquote> “this same Jesus” would one day return (Acts 1:11).</blockquote>

      <p>Ellen White writes:</p> <blockquote>“Christ’s ascension to heaven was the signal that His followers were to receive the promised blessing... Heaven was opened, and the church beheld the glory of the risen Redeemer.” (Acts of the Apostles, p. 38)</blockquote>
