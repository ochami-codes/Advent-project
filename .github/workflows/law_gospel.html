        <h1>The Law and the Gospel</h1>

        <p>Many see law and gospel as opposites—law condemns, gospel saves. But Scripture and the Spirit of Prophecy reveal that they work hand in hand. The law shows us our sin, and the gospel offers forgiveness and transformation. Together, they reveal the fullness of God’s plan of salvation.</p>

        <h2>The Law and the Gospel—Inseparable Twins</h2>

        <p><strong>Romans 3:20</strong> states, <blockquote>“By the law is the knowledge of sin.”</blockquote> The law serves as a mirror, exposing our guilt and pointing us to our need for a Savior. Without the law, we wouldn't know what sin is (<strong>Romans 7:7</strong>). The gospel doesn’t discard the law—it addresses the problem the law reveals.</p>

        <p><strong>Galatians 3:24</strong> says, <blockquote>“Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ.”</blockquote> It shows us our weakness and leads us to the foot of the cross. Christ's death did not cancel the law; it confirmed its authority by paying the penalty for our transgressions.</p>

        <p>Ellen White writes in <em>Faith and Works</em>, p. 102: <blockquote>“The law points to the gospel, and the gospel points to the law as a perfect rule of life.”</blockquote> The gospel reveals God’s mercy, while the law reflects His justice. Together they reveal the balance in God’s character.</p>

        <p>The gospel empowers us to live in obedience. <strong>Romans 8:4</strong> says the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us through the Spirit. This means the law doesn’t become obsolete—it becomes fulfilled in the believer’s life through Christlike living.</p>

        <h3>One Shows Us Our Need, the Other Meets It</h3>
        <p>The law and gospel are inseparable. One shows us our need; the other meets it. Together they lead us to repentance, faith, and obedience. When rightly understood, they reveal the harmony of justice and mercy in God’s plan of redemption.</p>
