            <h1>The Fall of Man</h1>
            <section>
                <!---<h2>Introduction</h2>-->
                <p>To test their allegiance, God gave the tree of knowledge of good and evil as a test. He promised that while they remained obedient, life was to be their reward.  If they disobeyed then death and decay were to be the consequences. Their choice was tragic and it opened the door which God never wanted to be opened.</p>

              <h2>The Choice was Tragic</h2> <p>The beautiful garden of Eden was a reflection of heaven, vibrant with life, peace, and joy. Adam and Eve were the crown of God's creation, made in His image, capable of love and reasoning, placed in a world without pain or death. But love, to be real, must include freedom.So God gave them a test: one tree,just one,that they must not touch.</p>

                 <p>Into this perfect setting, Satan entered, not with force, but with deception. Disguised as a serpent, he whispered doubt: </p>
                 <blockquote>“Has God indeed said…?”  (Genesis 3:1).
                 </blockquote> 
                 <p>The deceiver twisted truth with falsehood, appealing to Eve’s curiosity and pride.
                 </p>

                     <p>Ellen White comments,</p>
                     
                     <blockquote>“Eve had been perfectly happy by her husband’s side... but she was flattered with the idea of gaining greater wisdom”(PP, p. 53).</blockquote> 
                     </p>She fell, then Adam out of love for her chose to join her in disobedience.</p>

                     <p>In that single moment, the peace of Eden shattered. Sin entered. The image of God in man was marred, and death became a reality.</p>
                     <blockquote> “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin” (Romans 5:12).</blockquote>

                    <p>Yet God did not abandon humanity. Even as He pronounced the consequences, He gave a promise, a flicker of hope amid the gloom.</p>
