        <h1>The New Earth and the End of Sin</h1>

        <section>
           <!--- <h2>Introduction</h2>-->
            <p>Ever thought of a sinless world? A place where its inhabitants are selfless and are interested in the well-being of their fellows? A place where every thought and action is motivated by fervent love? We're promised in the Scriptures that God will restore the earth again. There will be no more sin, sorrow, death, pain, or anything that is against the principles of love.</p>
            <p>We should all yearn to inherit the earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. How blessed will be those who'll inherit the earth renewed!</p>

            <h2>Everything Will Be Restored</h2>
            <p>After the millennium, sin meets its final end. The wicked are resurrected, Satan deceives them one last time, and fire falls from heaven.</p>

            <blockquote>“And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death” (Revelation 20:14).</blockquote>

            <p>Then God makes all things new. No more pain. No more sorrow. No more death.</p>

            <blockquote>“Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men” (Revelation 21:3).</blockquote>

            <p>The redeemed will live in the New Earth, a restored Eden, where joy, beauty, and holiness reign forever.</p>

            <blockquote>“Pain cannot exist in the atmosphere of heaven. There will be no more tears, no funeral trains, no badges of mourning... One pulse of harmony and gladness beats through the vast creation.” (Great Controversy, p. 676)</blockquote>
