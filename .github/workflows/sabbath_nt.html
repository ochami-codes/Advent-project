          <h1> The Sabbath in the New Testament</h1>


<p>A common misconception is that the Sabbath was only for Jews and became obsolete after Christ’s death. However, a thorough reading of the New Testament reveals that the seventh-day Sabbath remains a part of God's eternal moral law. From the life of Jesus to the practices of the apostles, the Sabbath is consistently honored, observed, and taught as a special day of rest and worship. Let’s explore the clear evidence of the Sabbath’s presence and importance in the New Testament.</p>

<h2>New Testament Mentions the Sabbath</h2>
<p>Jesus Christ, the perfect example for Christians, kept the Sabbath throughout His earthly ministry. Luke 4:16 says,
</p> 
<blockquote>“And as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.” 
</blockquote>
<p>Christ not only kept the Sabbath, He elevated its true meaning by restoring it from legalistic traditions to a day of mercy, healing, and worship (Mark 2:27–28). He declared, “The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath,” asserting His authority over the day, not to abolish it, but to affirm its purpose.</p>

<p>Jesus predicted that His followers would still be keeping the Sabbath even after His resurrection. In Matthew 24:20, when warning about the destruction of Jerusalem (which happened in A.D. 70), He said,</p>
<blockquote>“But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day.”</blockquote>
<p>This statement, given decades in advance, implies the Sabbath would still be sacred and observed by Christians long after the cross.</p>

<p>The apostles, following Jesus’ example, continued Sabbath observance after His ascension. Acts 17:2 says,</p>
<blockquote>“And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures.” </blockquote>
<p>In Acts 13:42–44, the whole city—both Jews and Gentiles—came to hear the word of God on the Sabbath. These accounts clearly show that Sabbath-keeping was not limited to Jewish believers but was practiced by Gentile converts as well.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the New Testament is there a command to keep Sunday as the new day of worship. Instead, the New Testament upholds the commandments of God. Revelation 14:12 describes the saints in the last days as “they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” The Sabbath remains part of God’s moral law, which Christ did not come to destroy (Matthew 5:17–19). The idea of Sunday worship came later through church tradition, not divine command.</p>

<p>Ellen White confirms this truth in The Desire of Ages, p. 283:</p>
<blockquote> “As the Sabbath was the sign that distinguished Israel when they came out of Egypt to enter the earthly Canaan, so it is the sign that now distinguishes God's people as they come out from the world to enter the heavenly rest.”
</blockquote>
<p>The Sabbath is not about legalism—it is about loyalty, love, and a living connection with our Creator and Redeemer.</p>


<p>The New Testament strongly affirms the continuity of the Sabbath. It shows Jesus honoring the day, His disciples keeping it after His resurrection, and prophecy highlighting its role in the last days. The seventh-day Sabbath is eternal. As followers of Christ, we are called to walk as He walked (1 John 2:6), which includes delighting in the same sacred rest He delighted in. Let us not follow tradition but truth, worshiping God “in spirit and in truth” (John 4:24) by remembering His holy day.</p>
