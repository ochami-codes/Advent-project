    <h1>Entertainment and Media</h1>

    <p>
      In today’s digital world, entertainment and media are powerful tools that shape the mind, influence behavior, and direct the heart. For the Christian, the question is not merely, "Is it popular?" or "Is it fun?" but rather, "Does it glorify God?" The Bible gives this guiding principle:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:31).
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Ellen White warned, <blockquote>“Satan is using every means to make crime and debasing vice popular. We cannot walk with God while indulging our eyes, ears, and minds in corrupting influences” (<em>Adventist Home</em>, p. 516).</blockquote>
    </p>

    <h2>Guarding the Avenues of the Soul</h2>
    <p>
      The mind is shaped by what we allow through the senses—especially through the eyes and ears.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes” (Psalm 101:3)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      is a solemn commitment for every follower of Christ. Ellen White called the senses “the avenues to the soul,” and said,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “All should guard the senses, lest Satan gain victory over them” (<em>Counsels on Health</em>, p. 587).
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Watching or listening to things that promote violence, immorality, pride, or rebellion makes us spiritually weak and opens the door to temptation.
    </p>

    <h2>Choosing Uplifting Content</h2>
    <p>
      God is not against enjoyment, but He calls us to choose things that build character and glorify Him.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Whatsoever things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report… think on these things” (Philippians 4:8).
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Entertainment that leads us to pray more, love more, and obey God more is a blessing. Ellen White encouraged wholesome reading, music, and activities:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Let the youth be directed to sources of amusement that are pure and noble and elevating” (<em>Messages to Young People</em>, p. 384).
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      What we consume should draw us nearer to Christ, not away.
    </p>

    <h2>The Dangers of Modern Amusement</h2>
    <p>
      Much of today’s media culture—movies, music videos, social media trends, and even video games—is filled with messages that desensitize us to sin. Ellen White described such amusements as:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “a snare of Satan” meant to “lead men and women to forget God and eternal realities” (<em>Christ’s Object Lessons</em>, p. 54).
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Even seemingly innocent content can subtly plant seeds of vanity, envy, or sensuality. The devil doesn’t need to convince us to deny Christ outright—he only needs to distract us enough so we neglect Him.
    </p>

    <h2>Living Above the World’s Influence</h2>
    <p>
      Christians are called to be set apart—living by heaven’s standard rather than the world's.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind” (Romans 12:2).
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Ellen White wrote, <blockquote>“It is not safe for Christians to choose the society of those who have no love for God. Familiarity with the world blunts the sense of eternal things” (<em>Messages to Young People</em>, p. 391).</blockquote> Entertainment should never take priority over communion with God, mission, and holiness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Entertainment and media are not neutral—they are shaping us, moment by moment. A Christian lifestyle means filtering every form of media through the lens of Scripture and the example of Jesus. We must ask, “Does this help me grow spiritually, or pull me away from Christ?”
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Our only safety is in standing constantly in the light of God’s Word” (<em>The Great Controversy</em>, p. 598).
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      May we choose what uplifts the soul and honors the One who gave us life.
