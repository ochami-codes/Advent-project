          <h1>The Sabbath and the Seal of God</h1>


<p>In the final conflict between good and evil, Revelation presents two distinct groups: those who receive the mark of the beast and those who receive the seal of the living God. Understanding the seal of God is vital, for it identifies God’s faithful people. The Bible and Spirit of Prophecy reveal that the seventh-day Sabbath is deeply connected to this seal, it is God’s mark of authority, a sign of allegiance to the Creator, and a distinguishing feature of His end-time people.</p>

<h2>The Seal of God</h2>
<p>A seal in Bible times contained three essential elements: the name, the title, and the territory of the one in authority. For example, a presidential seal might read: “Joe Biden, President, United States of America.” Likewise, God’s seal is found in the heart of His law—the fourth commandment. It reads:
</p> 
<blockquote>“For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is” (Exodus 20:11).
</blockquote> 
<p>It contains His name ("the Lord"), His title ("Creator"), and His domain ("heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is"). No other commandment bears all three identifying features.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Ezekiel 20:12</strong> says,</p>
    <blockquote> “Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.” 
    </blockquote> 
    <p>Sabbath is not just a rest day, it is a sign of a sanctifying relationship with God. In verse 20, He repeats,</p>
    <blockquote> “Hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.”
    </blockquote> 
    <p>This connection between God and His people is sealed by Sabbath observance.</p>

<p>The book of Revelation describes a group who are sealed before the final plagues fall (Revelation 7:1–3). These saints are also described in Revelation 14:12 as 
</p>
<blockquote>“they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” 
</blockquote> 
<p>are not only believers in Christ, they are loyal to God’s law. In the final judgment, allegiance to God’s commandments, especially the fourth, becomes the test of loyalty. Ellen White confirms,
</p> 
<blockquote>“The sign, or seal, of God is revealed in the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath” (Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 8, p. 117).
</blockquote>

<p>This seal stands in contrast to the mark of the beast, which involves false worship and the observance of a counterfeit sabbath. Revelation 13 and 14 show a global crisis centered on worship. God calls all to worship Him as Creator <strong>(Revelation 14:7)</strong>, which points directly to Sabbath observance. Those who choose to honor the Sabbath, despite pressure and opposition, receive God’s seal, His mark of ownership and approval.</p>

<p>Ellen White warns,</p>
<blockquote> “The Sabbath will be the great test of loyalty, for it is the point of truth especially controverted” (The Great Controversy, p. 605).
</blockquote> 
<p>In the end, keeping the Sabbath will not be merely about rest, it will be a stand for God's authority over human traditions. It is how God will distinguish His true followers in the final crisis.</p>

<h3>The Sabbath is the Seal of God</h3>
<p>The Sabbath is more than a day of worship, it is the seal of the living God, identifying those who love, obey, and serve Him. As we draw closer to the final events of earth’s history, the Sabbath becomes a symbol of faithfulness. God invites us to receive His seal by keeping His Sabbath holy, in love and reverence. </p>
<blockquote>“Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples” (Isaiah 8:16).</blockquote>
<p>Let us be among those who are sealed, those who honor God’s law and glorify Him as the Creator of all.
