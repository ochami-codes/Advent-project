                <h1>The Heavenly Sanctuary and Christ's Ministry</h1>
                
                    <p>What do you think Christ is doing right now in heaven? Just seated there passively with His Father on the universe's throne? The Bible teaches that Christ is in the heavenly sanctuary mediating on our behalf. Through His intercession before the Father's throne, we receive power to overcome and live victorious lives.</p>
            
                
                    <h2>Christ is Our Advocate</h2>
                     <p>Jesus didn’t just disappear into heaven after His ascension. He entered a real, heavenly sanctuary as our High Priest <strong>(Hebrews 8:1–2)</strong>. Just as the Old Testament priests interceded for Israel, Christ now ministers in our behalf in the courts of heaven.</p>

                     <p>This is good news! Christ is not only our Savior but also our Advocate.
                     </p>
                     
                     <blockquote>“If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous” (1 John 2:1).
                     </blockquote>
                     <p>His blood speaks for us, offering mercy, cleansing, and victory.
                     </p>

                     <p>Ellen White affirms: </p>
                     <blockquote>“The sanctuary in heaven is the very center of Christ’s work in behalf of men... It is of the utmost importance that all should thoroughly investigate these subjects.” (Great Controversy, p. 488)</blockquote>

                     <p>As our High Priest, Christ is completing a work of judgment and cleansing, a final atonement. Soon, that work will be finished, and He will return, not as a lamb, but as King of kings.</p>
