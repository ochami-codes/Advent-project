                    Sufferings and much tribulations awakens in us a desire for Christ's coming. When will Christ come and put an end to all these sufferings? Why has He tarried so long? What is He waiting for? Despite all these questions, what we know is that Christ is coming again! No matter the delay, His word is assuring us that the time of His coming is very near. Are you ready dear? Ready to meet Him Whom we've desired for so long?

                <h2>He is Coming for You!</h2>
                    <p>The blessed hope of every believer is the return of Christ. He promised, </p>
                    <blockquote>“I will come again, and receive you unto Myself” (John 14:3).</blockquote> 
                    <p>His return will be visible, audible, and glorious, not a secret rapture, but the crowning moment of earth's history.</p>

                     <p>At His coming, the righteous dead will rise, and the living saints will be changed. </p>
                     <blockquote>“So shall we ever be with the Lord"(1 Thessalonians 4:17).</blockquote>

                     <p>Then comes the 1,000-year millennium. Satan is bound, the earth lies desolate, and the saints reign with Christ in heaven, reviewing the records of judgment <strong>(Revelation 20)</strong>. It is a time of justice, reflection, and preparation for the final destruction of sin.</p>

                     <p>Ellen White explains:</p><blockquote> “During the thousand years between the first and the second resurrection, the judgment of the wicked takes place... Every case is decided.” (Great Controversy, p. 661)</blockquote>
