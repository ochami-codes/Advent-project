         <h1> The End-Time Relevance of God's Law</h1>


<p>As the world races toward its final moments, God's law becomes increasingly significant. Far from being an outdated standard, the law will be the test of loyalty in the end times. Revelation reveals that God's faithful will be distinguished by their obedience to His commandments, even amid global opposition.</p>

<h2>Obedience is a Fruit of a Deep Relationship with Christ</h2>

<p> <strong>Revelation 14:12</strong> describes the last generation as those who <em>“keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”</em> This union of faith and obedience shows that law-keeping isn’t legalism, it’s the fruit of a deep relationship with Christ. It will mark those who refuse to follow the beast system.</p>

<p>Jesus warned in <strong>Matthew 24:12</strong> that</p>
<blockquote>“because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.”
</blockquote> 
<p>Lawlessness is a sign of the last days, and the erosion of moral boundaries proves we are nearing the final conflict between good and evil.</p>

<p>Ellen G. White writes in The Great Controversy, p. 605:</p>
<blockquote>“The Sabbath will be the great test of loyalty.” 
</blockquote>
<p>The fourth commandment, which honors God as Creator, will become the dividing line. True worshipers will stand firm on God’s law, even when threatened by economic and social pressure.</p>

<p>The world will be brought to a decision: follow human laws or God’s law. Revelation 12:17 says the dragon makes war with the remnant “which keep the commandments of God.” God’s law will again be at the heart of the controversy, and only those grounded in Scripture will endure.</p>


<h3>By Faith, We Will Overcome</h3>
<p>God’s law is not only relevant today—it is central to the end-time conflict. Obedience will test the faith and love of every soul. May we be among those who stand firm, keeping the commandments and holding fast the faith of Jesus.</p>
