      <h2>God's Promises in Trials</h2>

      <p>Trials are not signs that God has forsaken us. Rather, they are opportunities to prove the power and faithfulness of His promises. Every storm that darkens our skies carries with it the light of divine assurance—God is with us, and His Word cannot fail. In every valley, God’s promises shine as beacons of hope, comfort, and strength.</p>

      <div class="quote-bible"> 
        📖 “When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.” — Isaiah 43:2
      </div>

      <p>Our trials may seem overwhelming, but God’s Word remains our refuge. His promises are not vague hopes; they are divine guarantees sealed by His own faithfulness. In moments of fear, loss, or pain, His assurances whisper peace to the soul: “I see you. I am with you. I will carry you through.”</p>

        📚 “The Lord permits trials in order that we may be cleansed from earthliness, from selfishness, from harsh, unchristlike traits of character. He suffers the deep waters of affliction to go over our souls in order that we may know Him and Jesus Christ whom He has sent.” — *Ellen G. White, Christ's Object Lessons, p. 173*
      </div>

      <p>We are not left to suffer alone. Our Savior has walked the path of sorrow before us. He understands, He intercedes, and He sends His Spirit to comfort and uphold. When we feel weak, God promises strength. When we feel lost, He promises guidance. When our hearts are heavy, He promises peace that passes understanding.</p>

      <div class="quote-bible"> 
        📖 “Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.” — Psalm 34:19
      </div>

      <p>We may not always understand the purpose behind our suffering, but we can trust the One who holds our future. Trials refine our faith, develop our character, and prepare us for greater usefulness. Through every hardship, God's promises are a sure foundation beneath our feet.</p>

      <div class="quote-sop"> 
        📚 “To all who are reaching out to feel the guiding hand of God, the moment of greatest discouragement is the time when divine help is nearest.” — *Ellen G. White, The Ministry of Healing, p. 249*
      </div>

      <p>As we hold on to God's promises, our trials become testimonies. Our burdens become blessings in disguise. Let us not fear the furnace—it is heated not to destroy, but to purify. Let us cling to His Word, for He has said, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee" (Hebrews 13:5). In our darkest hour, His promises shine the brightest.</p>
