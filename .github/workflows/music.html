    <h1>Music and Worship</h1>

    <p>
      Music is one of the most powerful influences on the human heart. It can uplift or degrade, heal or harm, draw us to heaven or pull us to the world. In Christian worship, music is a sacred gift meant to glorify God and edify the soul. The psalmist declared,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Sing unto the Lord, bless His name; shew forth His salvation from day to day” (Psalm 96:2).
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Ellen White emphasized the importance of music in spiritual life, saying:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Music is one of the most effective means of impressing the heart with spiritual truth” (<em>Education</em>, p. 167).
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Music as a Form of Worship</h2>
    <p>
      Music is not just for entertainment; in the Christian life, it is a form of worship. The Bible is full of songs of praise, from David’s psalms to the songs sung in heaven. True worship music points to God’s holiness, mercy, and power. It stirs the heart to reverence, love, and surrender. Ellen White wrote:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “As a part of religious service, singing is as much an act of worship as is prayer” (<em>Education</em>, p. 168).
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Therefore, the kind of music we use in worship matters deeply. It must be sacred, reverent, and spiritually uplifting.
    </p>

    <h2>The Character of Heaven-Approved Music</h2>
    <p>
      Heaven-pleasing music is marked by purity, order, and simplicity—not confusion, noise, or sensual excitement. Paul encouraged believers to sing:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord” (Colossians 3:16).
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Ellen White described the music of angels as “in perfect harmony,” and warned that music which appeals to the flesh rather than the spirit is not fit for the sanctuary (<em>Testimonies for the Church</em>, Vol. 1, p. 509). Music should lift the soul heavenward, not stir up worldly feelings.
    </p>

    <h2>Dangers of Worldly Music</h2>
    <p>
      The devil knows the power of music and uses it to deceive, distract, and destroy. Much of today’s popular music promotes rebellion, sensuality, pride, and violence. Even some so-called “Christian music” imitates worldly styles, diluting the message of truth with emotionalism. Ellen White warned:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “When professed Christians… engage in singing that is not solemn and spiritual, the angels of God are grieved” (<em>Evangelism</em>, p. 510).
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      As followers of Christ, we must be careful not to adopt music that mirrors the spirit of the world.
    </p>

    <h2>Personal and Family Worship through Music</h2>
    <p>
      Music should also be a daily part of our personal devotion and family worship. Singing hymns or Scripture songs helps seal truth in the heart and uplift the soul. Families are encouraged to sing together as a way to grow closer to God and one another. Ellen White counseled:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Let there be singing in the home of songs that are sweet and pure, and there will be fewer words of complaint and more of cheerfulness and hope” (<em>Child Guidance</em>, p. 523).
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Music in the home is a blessing and a preparation for the worship of heaven.
    </p>

    <p>
      Music is a powerful spiritual gift that, when used rightly, brings glory to God and joy to the soul. It should not reflect the culture of the world but the character of Christ. As we prepare to join the heavenly choir, let us fill our lives with music that honors our Maker and prepares us for eternity. Ellen White’s words are a timely reminder:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Let everything be done in the worship of God with solemnity and deep feeling” (<em>Evangelism</em>, p. 510).
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Let our music be pure, uplifting, and anchored in truth.
