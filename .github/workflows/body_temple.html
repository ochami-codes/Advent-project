    <h1>Health and the Body Temple</h1>

    <p>The human body is a sacred dwelling place, designed by God to house His Spirit. Scripture reminds us in 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost, and we are to glorify God in our bodies and spirits. A Christian lifestyle includes intentional health practices that honor God’s design.</p>

    <p>Health reform is not merely about physical well-being, but spiritual growth. Ellen White affirms this truth:</p>
    <blockquote>"The health reform, I was shown, is a part of the third angel's message and is just as closely connected with it as the arm and hand with the human body." — *Counsels on Diet and Foods*, p. 69</blockquote>

    <p>We must view health as a divine responsibility. What we eat, drink, and do affects our mind and ability to discern God’s voice. Poor health often results from ignoring divine principles. Daniel’s example in Babylon (Daniel 1) reveals the importance of dietary faithfulness. His physical and mental sharpness stood as a testimony for God.</p>

    <p>God desires that His children prosper in health (3 John 1:2). This includes rest, fresh air, water, sunlight, temperance, and trust in divine power. True health reform prepares us to better serve others, think clearly, and resist temptation.</p>

    <p>Ellen White reminds us:</p>
    <blockquote>"The body is the only medium through which the mind and the soul are developed for the upbuilding of character." — *Ministry of Healing*, p. 130</blockquote>

    <p>If we abuse the body, we hinder our spiritual progress. Let us honor our Maker through wise, healthful choices.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, caring for the body temple is an act of worship. As we yield to God’s counsel on health, we glorify Him and prepare ourselves to fulfill His mission. May we walk in obedience and gratitude, treating our bodies as the sanctuaries they truly are.</p>
