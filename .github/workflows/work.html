    <h1>Work and Purpose</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Work is more than just a way to earn a living; it is a divine calling and a vital part of the Christian life. God created us to be productive and purposeful, and work is a means of serving Him and others.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men.” <br>
      <em>— Colossians 3:23</em>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “Work is a divine appointment and should be regarded as a sacred trust.” <br>
      <em>— Education, p. 234</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Understanding our purpose through work helps us glorify God and fulfill His plan.
    </p>

    <h2>Work as Worship and Service</h2>
    <p>
      Work done with the right heart attitude is a form of worship. It reflects our gratitude to God and our desire to bless others.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands.” <br>
      <em>— Ephesians 4:28</em>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “In order to glorify God, man must work.” <br>
      <em>— Education, p. 231</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Every honest task, done faithfully, is honorable in God’s sight.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose and Calling</h2>
    <p>
      Each Christian has a unique purpose and gifts to serve God’s kingdom. Discovering and embracing this calling brings joy and fulfillment.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “The parable of the talents teaches us to use our abilities productively.” <br>
      <em>— Matthew 25:14–30</em>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “God has given each one his work… not only to earn a livelihood but to develop character and fit for heaven.” <br>
      <em>— Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 346</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Purposeful work builds character and prepares us for eternal reward.
    </p>

    <h2>Balancing Work and Rest</h2>
    <p>
      God instituted the Sabbath as a time of rest and spiritual renewal.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy... the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God.” <br>
      <em>— Exodus 20:8–11</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      While work is important, so is rest and worship.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “True rest is rest in Jesus, a resting of the mind and soul upon the Lord.” <br>
      <em>— The Desire of Ages, p. 330</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Christians should balance diligence with the Sabbath principle, avoiding overwork and burnout. Proper rest rejuvenates us to serve God more effectively.
    </p>

    <h2>Work as Witness</h2>
    <p>
      Our work ethic and attitude witness to the world about Christ’s transforming power.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “By your good conduct… let them see your good works and glorify God.” <br>
      <em>— 1 Peter 2:12</em>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “The honest, diligent laborer will win the respect of his fellowmen and a crown of life from his Master.” <br>
      <em>— Education, p. 235</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Through work, we demonstrate integrity, faithfulness, and God’s love, attracting others to Christ.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Work is a sacred calling that blends service, worship, and purpose. When done with the right heart, it builds character, glorifies God, and impacts others for eternity.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “The blessing of God rests upon the faithful laborer.” <br>
      <em>— Education, p. 232</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Let us embrace our work as part of God’s plan, working joyfully and faithfully for His glory.
