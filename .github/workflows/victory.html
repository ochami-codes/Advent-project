            <h1>The Cross: Victory Over Sin</h1>
            
                <p>Addicted, chained, desperate, and longing for freedom from sin's powerful grip but to no avail? Have you lost hope over your situation? Are your efforts so feeble? Are your promises to become a better person likened to ropes of sand that cannot tie anything? It was because we are weak and powerless that the Son of God came. For those who accept Christ, sin loses its dominion over them. In Christ we're more than conquerors!</p>
            
            
                <h2>The Cross is Our Hope</h2>
                  <p> At the heart of the Christian faith stands the cross—a symbol of shame in Roman times, but the greatest banner of victory in all eternity. On that rugged hill of Calvary, Jesus bore the crushing weight of the world's sin.</p>

                    <p>Satan thought the cross would be his triumph. He stirred up hatred, jealousy, and betrayal, thinking he could extinguish the Light of the world. But the cross didn’t mark Christ’s defeat—it was His moment of glory.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>“Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out” (John 12:31).</blockquote>

                    <p>Ellen White powerfully states:</p> <blockquote>“Christ did not yield up His life till He had accomplished the work which He came to do... Through the cross, the sinner was drawn to God, and God to the sinner.”(Desire of Ages, p. 758)
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>At the cross, the penalty of sin was paid. The power of sin was broken. The love of God was vindicated before the universe. Every soul who looks to Calvary sees not just suffering, but victory—the defeat of Satan and the freedom of mankind.</p>
