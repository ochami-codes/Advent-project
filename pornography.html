    <h1>The Snare of Pornography</h1>

      <p>
        This is one of the most successful snares of the devil. There is no invention more appealing to the 
        carnal mind than exposure to pornography in its many forms. It hides in novels, movies, advertisements, 
        websites, videos, and more. With smartphones and constant internet access, this trap has become 
        accessible to almost everyone. Indeed, the pornographic industry is a multi-trillion-dollar empire 
        that trades in human souls.

        Society reflects the impact of this corruption, normalizing immodest dress and shameless entertainment. 
        But what are its dangers? What does God say about it? And most importantly, how can we break away 
        from its powerful grip?

      <h2>The Sinfulness of Pornography</h2>
      <p>
        First, we must admit that consuming pornography is exceedingly sinful, degrading, and corrupting. 
        It enslaves the mind and defiles the soul. God’s Word plainly warns:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="bible">
        “But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery 
        with her already in his heart.”  
        <span>— Matthew 5:28</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="bible">
        “For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, 
        is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he 
        that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.”  
        <span>— 1 John 2:16–17</span>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Testimonies from the Spirit of Prophecy</h2>
      <blockquote class="sop">
        “Impure pictures have a corrupting influence…. The lust of the eye and corrupt passions are aroused 
        by beholding and by reading…. The mind takes pleasure in contemplating scenes which awaken the lower 
        and baser passions. These vile images, seen through defiled imagination, corrupt the morals and 
        prepare the deluded, infatuated beings to give loose rein to lustful passions. Then follow sins 
        and crimes which drag beings formed in the image of God down to a level with the beasts, 
        sinking them at last in perdition.”  
        <span>— Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, p. 410 (1870); 1MCP 229–230</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="sop">
        “By beholding we become changed.”  
        <span>— The Great Controversy, p. 555</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Continuous exposure to pornography degrades character until men and women reflect the very image of 
        lust, losing self-control and dishonoring God.

      <h2>Scientific and Medical Evidence</h2>
      <blockquote class="science">
        Neuroscience shows that pornography hijacks the brain’s reward system, overstimulating dopamine 
        pathways in the same way addictive drugs do. This leads to tolerance (needing more extreme content), 
        withdrawal symptoms, and compulsive behavior that mirrors substance addiction.  
        <span>— Kühn & Gallinat, JAMA Psychiatry, 2014</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="science">
        Studies also link pornography use to increased anxiety, depression, sexual dysfunction, and 
        relationship dissatisfaction. Over time, the brain’s ability to experience normal intimacy 
        diminishes, fueling isolation and broken families.

      <h2>The Way of Escape</h2>
      <p>
        God has not left us to fight this battle alone. Victory is possible only through Christ’s power. 
        We must renounce every unclean influence, guard the avenues of the soul, and feed our minds on what 
        is pure and holy.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="bible">
        “Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are 
        just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; 
        if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.”  
        <span>— Philippians 4:8</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="sop">
        “Through the right exercise of the will, an entire change may be made in the life. By yielding up the 
        will to Christ, we ally ourselves with divine power. A pure and noble life, a life of victory over 
        appetite and lust, is possible to everyone who will unite his weak, wavering human will to the 
        omnipotent, unwavering will of God.”  
        <span>— Ministry of Healing, p. 176</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Pornography is a deadly snare, but Jesus offers freedom. By His grace, we can break free, 
        live pure lives, and reflect His image once again.
