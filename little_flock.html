    <p>
      A mother stands trembling before the awesome presence of the Ancient of Days. His flaming eyes pierce through her very being, and she shudders at His majesty. Suddenly, her gaze lifts, and she sees a happy multitude approaching from the north—a company of faithful nursing mothers, eager to teach, guide, and nurture the children entrusted to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, the One seated on the throne speaks:  
      <blockquote class="bible">
        Where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      She looks in vain. She cannot see her children among the shining hosts on the glassy sea before the throne of the Universe’s King. Her heart races, her lips go dry, and dread fills her soul. She must give an account of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      She awakens in terror, sheets drenched in sweat, and yet—even if it was but a dream—the piercing gaze of the Almighty and that solemn question remain engraved upon her mind: <em>“Where is thy beautiful flock?”</em>
    </p>

    <h2>Why is God so Concerned About Children?</h2>
    <p>
      When Lucifer and a third of the angels rebelled, heaven was left vacant. Who would fill these heavenly vacancies? God planned to prepare a people fit to dwell with the sinless heavenly family. And the instrument He chose to accomplish this was marriage. Marriage was designed by God as a means to multiply a godly seed for His kingdom.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Did He not make one? Yet had He the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That He might seek a godly seed.
      <span class="ref">— Malachi 2:15</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Through marriage, God intended to raise a generation prepared to live with Him eternally. Children are not merely gifts—they are sacred trusts, entrusted to parents to develop a character fit for heaven.
    </p>

    <h2>The Sacred Role of Mothers</h2>
    <p>
      The responsibility rests especially upon mothers, who are called to bring up their children “in the nurture and admonition of the Lord” (Ephesians 6:4).
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      The mother’s work is given her of God, to bring up her children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
      <span class="ref">— Adventist Home, p. 181</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Paul commends Timothy’s mother and grandmother for their faithfulness:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded now lives in you also.
      <span class="ref">— 2 Timothy 1:5</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Solomon underscores the enduring value of a mother’s instruction:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.
      <span class="ref">— Proverbs 1:8</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Cosmic Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      The Bible and Spirit of Prophecy are replete with references to the sacred responsibility of mothers in preparing children as heirs of heaven. Mothers are co-workers with God, essential participants in the cosmic conflict. By raising their children in righteousness, they help secure the victory of God’s plan.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      The mother who neglects her children neglects a sacred trust. The character of the children is forming for eternity. If they are not trained in obedience to God, they are leaving the way open for the enemy of souls to plant the seeds of evil in their hearts.
      <span class="ref">— Child Guidance, p. 29</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Whenever mothers neglect their God-given duties, they give the enemy an opportunity to sow tares in the lives of those who could otherwise have been heirs of heaven. The stakes are eternal.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Thus, every mother’s work is cosmic in scope. The care, guidance, and instruction of children are not merely earthly duties—they are part of God’s plan in the great controversy, shaping the destiny of souls for eternity. The question still echoes down through the ages:
