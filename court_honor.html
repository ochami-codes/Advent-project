    <h1>Set Apart For Purity</h1>
  </div>

  <main>
    <p>The world has normalized sex before marriage provided that those involved are “dating.” The name of the Lord is blasphemed because the professed children of God have turned their backs from following the way ordained by heaven.</p>

    <p>We now see <strong>cohabiting</strong>, <strong>mutual sexual relationships</strong>, <strong>abortion</strong>, and <strong>unplanned pregnancies</strong> even among those who claim to be Christians. Heartbreaks often follow—deep and scarring—because of <em>soul ties</em> formed through sexual intimacy outside of God’s plan.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? … Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
      <span class="ref">1 Corinthians 6:15,18</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>God’s Children Must Be Different</h2>
    <p>
      In contrast to the world’s culture of casual sex and emotional recklessness, <strong>God’s children must reflect the purity of Christ</strong>. Every part of our lives—including our relationships—should bring glory to His name.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      Let every step toward a marriage alliance be characterized by modesty, simplicity, and an earnest purpose to please and honor God.
      <span class="ref">Adventist Home, p. 49</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The goal of a Christian relationship is not experimentation or emotional excitement—but to discover whether the other person is the one God has appointed to walk with you toward eternity.</p>

    <h2>1. Set Boundaries — Because You Value God's Presence</h2>
    <p>
      God’s children must be intentional. Emotional and physical closeness must not be allowed to blur the line between affection and sin. Set boundaries—not out of fear, but out of love for God.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
      <span class="ref">Matthew 5:8</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Be careful with how much time you spend alone. Be watchful of “idle words,” suggestive texting, and emotionally charged conversations late at night. Remember, it is easier to prevent temptation than to fight it when it’s already too late.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Practice Self-Control — A Fruit of the Spirit</h2>
    <p>
      It is not weak to walk away from compromise; it is Christlike.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      But the fruit of the Spirit is… self-control.
      <span class="ref">Galatians 5:22–23</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Don’t entertain passions that you know are inappropriate before marriage. Self-control, like any spiritual gift, must be cultivated by prayer, Bible study, and accountability.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      Those who are planning to marry should consider what will be the character and influence of the home they will form. Will it be such as Heaven can approve?
      <span class="ref">Adventist Home, p. 35</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>3. Avoid Compromising Situations</h2>
    <p>
      Let purity be guarded by wisdom. Avoid circumstances where temptation thrives. That includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Late-night private visits</li>
      <li>Secluded meetings or trips alone</li>
      <li>Emotionally intimate conversations with physical closeness</li>
      <li>Consuming media or music that stirs sensuality</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Instead, keep it <strong>public, open, and simple</strong>.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Abstain from all appearance of evil.
      <span class="ref">1 Thessalonians 5:22</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>4. Involve Parents and Godly Mentors</h2>
    <p>
      Don’t walk this journey alone. God has given parents and spiritual elders to give perspective, caution, and encouragement.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Honor thy father and thy mother.
      <span class="ref">Exodus 20:12</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A man or woman who shuns parental guidance is unfit to lead or follow in marriage.</p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      In the choice of a husband or wife, let it be the aim to secure life’s highest and purest joys… Seek counsel from God-fearing parents and friends.
      <span class="ref">Adventist Home, p. 70</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>5. Modesty in Dress and Words</h2>
    <p>
      Modesty is more than clothing—it's an attitude. In your interactions, keep the tone respectful and pure. Avoid flirtation, manipulation, or dress meant to arouse instead of reflect Christ.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel… with good works.
      <span class="ref">1 Timothy 2:9–10</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      True love is a high and holy principle, altogether different in character from that love which is awakened by impulse and which suddenly dies when severely tested.
      <span class="ref">Adventist Home, p. 50</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      God has called us to a higher standard—<strong>a life that brings honor to His name</strong> in every relationship. Love is not proven by how far someone is willing to go physically, but by how far they are willing to go to protect your soul.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
      <span class="ref">1 Timothy 4:12</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Let us walk in purity, guided by principle, empowered by grace, and set apart for God’s glory.</p>
