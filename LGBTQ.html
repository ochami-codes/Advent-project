    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In our time, one of the strongest snares of the enemy is the distortion of God’s plan for sexuality and marriage. Satan has introduced perversions that blur the holy distinction established by the Creator at the beginning—“male and female created He them” (Genesis 1:27). Of all sexual perversions, same-sex intimacy stands out as one of the most unnatural, revolting, and destructive deviations from God’s design. Yet, it is now widely celebrated and even legalized, often under the guise of “human rights” and “love.” As Christians, we must test everything by the Word of God and not by the shifting opinions of men (Isaiah 8:20).
    </p>

    <h2>Biblical Foundation</h2>
    <p>The Bible is unambiguous in its condemnation of homosexual practice. Paul, under inspiration, describes it as the fruit of rejecting the knowledge of God:</p>
    <blockquote class="bible">
      For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly…
      <span class="ref">Romans 1:26–27, KJV</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Old Testament is equally clear:</p>
    <blockquote class="bible">
      Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.
      <span class="ref">Leviticus 18:22</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This divine prohibition shows that God views homosexual practice as an act against the created order and against His holiness. Furthermore, Christ reaffirmed in Matthew 19:4–6 that marriage is between one man and one woman, joined together by God.</p>

    <h2>Spirit of Prophecy Insights</h2>
    <p>Ellen G. White consistently warned against moral corruption and the perversions that led to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah:</p>
    <blockquote class="sop">
      The sins that brought destruction upon the old world exist today. That which is lawful and right they abuse, and that which is sinful they exalt. The same sin that brought judgments upon the world in the days of Noah exists today. It is the sin of Sodom—the sin of unnatural crime.
      <span class="ref">Adventist Home, p. 122</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      Licentiousness is the special sin of this age… Satan is leading the human race to indulge the vilest passions.
      <span class="ref">Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 346</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>From these warnings, it is evident that the acceptance of homosexuality and other sexual perversions is not just a cultural trend but a fulfillment of end-time prophecy about widespread moral decay.</p>

    <h2>Scientific and Social Consequences</h2>
    <p>Even aside from the spiritual perspective, research confirms that same-sex practices carry serious physical and mental health risks. Medical studies have shown:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Higher prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (including HIV/AIDS) among men who have sex with men compared to heterosexual populations (CDC, 2022).</li>
      <li>Increased rates of depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation, partly due to the unnatural lifestyle and its consequences (American Journal of Public Health, 2016).</li>
      <li>Breakdowns of stable family structures where same-sex “marriages” are normalized, undermining the natural role of fatherhood and motherhood in raising children.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote class="science">
      These outcomes testify that God’s law is not arbitrary but protective, designed for human happiness and health. Whenever it is transgressed, humanity suffers.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Apostasy in the Church</h2>
    <p>What makes the matter worse is that some churches, which should be the “pillar and ground of the truth” (1 Timothy 3:15), have embraced and even blessed these abominations. Instead of calling sin by its right name, they redefine it as holiness. Ellen White warned of such apostasy:</p>
    <blockquote class="sop">
      The world is filled with transgression of the law of God. Men have reached a point of insolence that makes it necessary for God to interfere.
      <span class="ref">Christ Triumphant, p. 138</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>When churches legalize what God calls sin, they are no longer light-bearers but agents of darkness.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Homosexuality and all associated perversions are not mere “alternative lifestyles” but open rebellion against the Creator’s order. They are signs of a world that has rejected God. As faithful believers, we must not compromise. We are called to “cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression” (Isaiah 58:1). At the same time, we must pray for those trapped in these sins, pointing them to the saving power of Christ who can deliver from every bondage (1 Corinthians 6:9–11).</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus.
      <span class="ref">1 Corinthians 6:11</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The good news is that no matter the depth of sin, Christ can restore purity and victory.</p>
