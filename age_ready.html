    <h1>At What Age Am I Ready for Marriage?</h1>
  </div>

  <main>

    <p>
      Some so hastily and prematurely engage in marriage alliances and end up regretting later. Teens marrying teens, couples standing at the altar without comprehending what they’re getting into—this is the sad reality even among professed Christians. The results? Broken hearts, broken homes, separations, and confusion within the church.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      Satan is constantly busy to hurry inexperienced youth into a marriage alliance.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Surprised? It’s one of Satan’s <strong>most successful devices</strong> to trap immature minds into alliances that dishonor God and ruin lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      In consequence of hasty marriages—even among God's people—there are painful separations, divorces, and an undermining of the church's moral influence. Teens may feel grown, but they are simply <strong>not ready</strong>. The inspired counsel is clear:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      A youth not out of his teens is a poor judge of the fitness of a person as young as himself to be his companion for life.
    </blockquote>
    <p class="ref">– Adventist Home, p. 79.4</p>

    <h2>So... If You’re Out of Your Teens, Are You Now Ready?</h2>

    <p><strong>Simply, no.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Age does not equal readiness. <strong>Marriage is a sacred milestone</strong>, and before stepping into it, deep reflection is needed. Hear this solemn warning:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      If those who are contemplating marriage would not have miserable, unhappy reflections after marriage, they must make it a subject of serious, earnest reflection now. This step taken unwisely is one of the most effective means of ruining the usefulness of young men and women. Life becomes a burden, a curse.
    </blockquote>
    <p class="ref">– Adventist Home, p. 43.1</p>

    <p>
      No one can bless—or curse—you like your spouse. A careless marriage can <strong>chill your hopes</strong>, <strong>paralyze your energy</strong>, and <strong>destroy your influence</strong>. Marriage can either be your stepping stone to heaven—or your ladder to despair.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you mature in age, don't trust your own judgment alone. <strong>Depend on God</strong>, His Word, and your godly parents or mentors.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      What a contrast between the course of Isaac and that pursued by the youth of our time, even among professed Christians! Young people too often feel that the bestowal of their affections is a matter in which self alone should be consulted—a matter that neither God nor their parents should in any wise control.
    </blockquote>
    <p class="ref">– Adventist Home, p. 80.4</p>

    <p>
      Today, many marry impulsively, ignoring prayer, counsel, and principle. Only a few years into marriage, they realize their error—when it's already too late.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion: So, When Are You Ready for Marriage?</h2>

    <p>
      Marriage readiness is not defined by <strong>chronological age</strong>, but by <strong>spiritual, emotional, and practical maturity</strong>. You are ready for marriage when:
    </p>

    <h3>1. You are fully surrendered to God.</h3>
    <p>
      You must be led by Christ before you can lead or support a godly home.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="bible">
      Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
    </blockquote>
    <p class="ref">– Matthew 6:33</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Can two walk together, except they be agreed?
    </blockquote>
    <p class="ref">– Amos 3:3</p>

    <h3>2. You understand the sacredness of marriage.</h3>
    <p>
      This is not a social contract or emotional trial run—it’s a <strong>holy covenant</strong> before God.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="bible">
      What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
    </blockquote>
    <p class="ref">– Mark 10:9</p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      Marriage is something that will influence and affect your life both in this world and in the world to come.
    </blockquote>
    <p class="ref">– Adventist Home, p. 44.2</p>

    <h3>3. You’ve received counsel from God and godly mentors.</h3>
    <p>
      Just as Abraham and Isaac sought divine and parental guidance, so must we.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="sop">
      In early life, when passion is strongest, they should be subject to the restraint of reason and religion.
    </blockquote>
    <p class="ref">– Adventist Home, p. 80.3</p>

    <h3>4. You’ve developed self-discipline and life responsibility.</h3>
    <p>
      If you can't manage your own life yet—your finances, emotions, or habits—how will you manage a household or raise children?
    </p>

    <h3>5. You are marrying with purpose, not impulse.</h3>
    <p>
      Godly marriage is built on <strong>mission and principle</strong>, not just romantic feelings.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="sop">
      In a marriage alliance, it’s not the passing beauty that counts, but moral worth, Christian character, and spiritual maturity.
    </blockquote>
    <p class="ref">– Adventist Home, p. 45.1</p>

    <h2>Final Words</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Are you ready for marriage?</strong> Not just by age, but by readiness of heart, mind, and spirit?
    </p>

    <p>
      Satan hurries people into foolish unions that ruin lives. But God calls you to <strong>patience</strong>, <strong>prayer</strong>, and <strong>principled preparation</strong>. Don’t rush. Wait for God’s time. Let Him write your love story.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths.
    </blockquote>
    <p class="ref">– Proverbs 3:6</p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      Let those who are contemplating marriage weigh every sentiment and watch every development of character in the one with whom they think to unite their life destiny.
    </blockquote>
    <p class="ref">– Adventist Home, p. 45.2</p>

    <p>
      Wait for God’s time. Marry for His glory. And let Christ be the foundation of your future home.
