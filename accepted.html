<h2>True Worship: What God Rejects and What He Accepts</h2>

<p>📖 Based on Deuteronomy 23:18</p>

---

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Is God concerned on how we get our money? Is He concerned about the source of tithes, offerings and the gifts we bring in His house? God's house is holy and so is His work, shouldn't the treasures we take to His house reflect the character of a holy God?</p>
<p>In our walk with God, we often focus on what to give Him; our tithes, our time, our talents. But the Bible also teaches us that how we obtain what we offer matters just as much as the offering itself. In Deuteronomy 23:18, we find a strong warning about unacceptable offerings. At first glance, it may seem strange or harsh, but when we look deeper, we uncover a powerful lesson about worship, purity, and integrity.</p>

<h3>📜 The Scripture in Focus</h3>

<p class="quote-bible"> "Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even both these are abomination unto the LORD thy God."
— Deuteronomy 23:18, KJV</p>



<p>At its core, this verse forbids the Israelites from bringing money earned through sexual immorality into the house of God as an offering. The “hire of a whore” refers to prostitution, and the “price of a dog” is a reference to male prostitutes, a practice often associated with pagan temple worship.</p>

<h3> Why Such a Command?</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>God is Holy</strong> — Worship must reflect His character. Offering Him what was earned through sin was a direct insult to His holiness (Isaiah 1:13).</li>


  <li><strong>Israel Was to Be Set Apart</strong>— Pagan religions involved temple prostitution, blending immorality with worship. God wanted Israel’s worship to be pure and free from such corruption (Leviticus 18:24–30).</li>


  <li><strong>The Principle Is Eternal</strong> —God doesn’t just want our gifts; He wants our hearts. An offering from impure earnings reveals an impure motive.</li>
  </ol>

<h3>🌍 Application for Today</h3>

<p>While most believers today aren’t tempted to bring such literal offerings, this principle still applies to modern stewardship:

Are we earning money honestly and ethically?

Are we supporting God’s work with resources gained through faithful labor, not manipulation, fraud, or compromise?

Do we try to appease God with gifts, while refusing to repent of the sin behind them?</p>


<p>The truth is, God doesn’t need our money. He wants pure hearts, and offerings that reflect a life of obedience and gratitude.</p>

<h3>🕊️ The Gospel’s Power to Redeem</h3>

<p>Let’s be clear: the message here isn’t “God doesn’t want sinners.” On the contrary, He came to seek and save the lost (Luke 19:10). Women like Rahab, a former harlot, and Mary Magdalene, who had lived in sin, were transformed and honored by Christ. What God rejects is sinful compromise, not the repentant soul.</p>

<p class="quote-sop"> “Christ recognized no caste, no nationality, no rank among men... He passed by no human being as worthless.”
— The Desire of Ages, p. 86</p>



<p>When we come to God with a surrendered heart, no matter our past, He cleanses and accepts us (1 John 1:9).</p>

<h3>Conclusion: Pure Offerings from Pure Hearts</h3>

<p>Deuteronomy 23:18 reminds us that God values purity over performance. He cannot be bribed with offerings earned through evil. Whether in money, ministry, or worship, what we give to God must reflect a heart that has been redeemed, renewed, and real.</p>

<p>Let us examine not only what we give, but how we earn and offer it. In Christ, we are called to a higher standard , a life of holy integrity, where our worship is a sweet aroma, not a stench (Ephesians 5:2).</p>
