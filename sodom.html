  <h1>The Last Night in Sodom: A Solemn Warning for Our Time</h1>

  <p>A fat and corrupt businessman sat dreaming up his next scheme—yet another twisted strategy to gain wealth through deceit and oppression. Meanwhile, a throng of perverse revelers roamed the streets, seeking the next victim to satisfy their sinful lusts. From old women to youths, from elders to children, the city was gripped by passions as dark as any that could dwell in the human heart. Pleasure-seeking was the sole purpose of life in Sodom.</p>

  <p><strong>Haven’t they gone too far? Why has God borne with them for so long? Have they not filled the cup of their iniquity to the brim?</strong></p>

  <blockquote class="quote-sop">
    “In the twilight two strangers drew near to the city gate. They were apparently travelers coming in to tarry for the night. None could discern in those humble wayfarers the mighty heralds of divine judgment, and little dreamed the gay, careless multitude that in their treatment of these heavenly messengers that very night they would reach the climax of the guilt which doomed their proud city.” — <em>Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 158.1</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lot, the only righteous man in Sodom, welcomed the strangers into his home. But as the night deepened, the city's corruption reached its peak:</p>

  <blockquote class="quote-bible">
    “But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter: And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.” — <em>Genesis 19:4-5</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>That act sealed Sodom’s fate. The cup of their iniquity was full.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote-sop">
    “The inhabitants of Sodom had passed the limits of divine forbearance—‘the hidden boundary between God's patience and His wrath.’ The fires of His vengeance were about to be kindled in the vale of Siddim.” — <em>PP 159.2</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The angels then revealed their mission:</p>

  <blockquote class="quote-sop">
    “We will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.” — <em>PP 159.3</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lot tried to warn his relatives, but they mocked him. They could not believe that judgment was at the door. Though Lot hesitated, loath to abandon his possessions and loved ones, the mercy of God prevailed:</p>

  <blockquote class="quote-sop">
    “Stupefied with sorrow, he lingered, loath to depart. But for the angels of God, they would all have perished in the ruin of Sodom. The heavenly messengers took him and his wife and daughters by the hand and led them out of the city.” — <em>PP 160.1</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Then morning came.</p>

  <p>The birds sang, and the fertile valley promised prosperity and peace. People bustled through the streets, laughing, planning, pursuing business and pleasure. Lot’s sons-in-law continued to scoff at his warnings. But suddenly—like thunder from a clear sky—judgment struck.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote-sop">
    “The Lord rained brimstone and fire out of heaven upon the cities and the fruitful plain; its palaces and temples, costly dwellings, gardens and vineyards, and the gay, pleasure-seeking throngs that only the night before had insulted the messengers of heaven—all were consumed. The smoke of the conflagration went up like the smoke of a great furnace.” — <em>PP 162.2</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>God is long-suffering, but He is not forever-suffering. His mercy has a limit.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote-sop">
    “We are taught the fearful and solemn lesson that while God's mercy bears long with the transgressor, there is a limit beyond which men may not go on in sin. When that limit is reached, then the offers of mercy are withdrawn, and the ministration of judgment begins.” — <em>PP 162.3</em>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote class="quote-bible">
    “As it was in the days of Lot... even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.” — <em>Luke 17:28, 30</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Isn’t this a solemn warning for us who await Christ’s return? How are you living your life?</p>

  <blockquote class="quote-sop">
    “Those who hear the gospel invitation calling sinners to repentance, and heed it not, are more guilty before God than were the dwellers in the vale of Siddim. And still greater sin is theirs who profess to know God and to keep His commandments, yet who deny Christ in their character and their daily life.” — <em>PP 165.1</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Friend, are you trifling with the mercy of God? Are you denying Christ by your lifestyle, your choices, your silence? Do not think that divine judgment will never come. The cup of iniquity is filling fast—for individuals, for cities, for nations. And when it overflows, it will be too late.</p>

  <p><strong>Now is the time to repent. Now is the time to turn from sin. Now is the time to seek the Lord while He may be found.</strong></p>
