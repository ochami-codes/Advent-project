    <h1>Fornication: A Sin Against God</h1>

      <p>
        By definition, fornication is sexual relations between people who are not married to one another. 
        It is one of the most prevalent sins of our age and surely calls down the wrath of God upon its perpetrators.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sadly, this sin is not only rampant in the world—which knows not God—but has also crept into the lives 
        of many professed Christians. The involvement of God’s people in such unholy practices makes the matter 
        even more grievous.

      <h2>Biblical Warnings</h2>
      <blockquote class="bible">
        “Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, 
        lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, 
        envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also 
        told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”  
        <span>— Galatians 5:19–21</span>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="bible">
        “Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication 
        sinneth against his own body.”  
        <span>— 1 Corinthians 6:18</span>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>A Solemn Warning from God’s Messenger</h2>
      <blockquote class="sop">
        “Warn every soul that is in danger. Leave none to deceive themselves. Call sin by its right name. 
        Declare what God has said in regard to lying, Sabbathbreaking, stealing, idolatry, and every other evil.”  
        <span>— Desire of Ages, p. 806</span>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="sop">
        “I saw, I heard, things that would make angels blush…. No young man should do as you have done to Mattie 
        unless married to her…. Will you now change entirely, cut the last connection with Mattie? … If neither of 
        you will do this, marry her at once and disgrace yourselves and the cause of God no more.”  
        <span>— Letter 61, 1880; TSB 118–119</span>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="sop">
        “Your acts and conversation are offensive to God…. The course you have pursued is a reproach to the cause 
        of God…. You give occasion to our enemies to judge our people as being loose in morals.”  
        <span>— TSB, p. 118</span>

      <h2>The Call to Purity in Christ</h2>
      <blockquote class="bible">
        “But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints.”  
        <span>— Ephesians 5:3</span>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="bible">
        “My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.”  
        <span>— 2 Corinthians 12:9</span>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="sop">
        “Christ has made provision that His church shall be a transformed body, illumined with the Light of heaven, 
        possessing the glory of Emmanuel. It is His purpose that every Christian shall be surrounded with a spiritual 
        atmosphere of light and peace.”  
        <span>— Acts of the Apostles, p. 600</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        If we lean upon Christ’s arm, He will lead us into purity and victory over temptation. His righteousness 
        alone can clothe us and make us stand pure before God.
