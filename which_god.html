    <h1>Are You Worshipping the True God of the Bible?</h1>
  </header>
  <div class="container">
    <section class="card">
      <p>You’ll often hear people say:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>“My God doesn’t mind if I wear this…”</em></li>
        <li><em>“My God doesn’t mind if I work on the Sabbath…”</em></li>
        <li><em>“My God doesn’t mind if I eat pork or drink alcohol…”</em></li>
        <li><em>“My God looks on the heart—what I do doesn’t matter!”</em></li>
      </ul>

      <p>It’s true that the god they’re describing doesn’t mind—but that’s not the God of the Bible. That’s a god they have created in their own imagination: a “god” that approves sin and excuses disobedience.</p>

      <p>When God said, <div class="quote-bible">“Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” (Genesis 1:26)</div>, His purpose was for man to reflect His image and character. But fallen humanity has reversed this. Instead of reflecting God’s character, people have created gods that reflect their own sinful desires and tried to insert them into the Bible.</p>

      <p>Instead of worshipping the Creator, many worship a god of their own making. Inspiration warns:</p>
      
      <div class="quote-sop">
        The enemy of souls has sought to bring into the experience of God’s people the supposition that a change of character is not essential. “Only believe,” they say, “and you will be saved.” But true faith works by love and purifies the soul.  
        <br>— Ellen G. White, <em>Faith and Works</em>, p. 100
      </div>

      <p>Concerning the true God, Scripture says:</p>

      <div class="quote-bible">
        But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity.  
        <br>— Hebrews 1:8-9
      </div>

      <p>The God of the Bible <strong>hates sin and loves righteousness</strong>. But the gods people invent for themselves <strong>love sin and hate righteousness</strong>. Jesus Himself said, <div class="quote-bible">“If ye love me, keep my commandments.” (John 14:15)</div></p>

      <p>When the way to heaven appears narrow, many prefer to widen it by inventing a “god” that approves their sinful choices. Yet the Bible is clear:</p>

      <div class="quote-bible">
        Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction… and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.  
        <br>— Matthew 7:13-14
      </div>

      <div class="quote-sop">
        The greatest deception of the human mind in Christ’s day was that a mere assent to the truth constitutes righteousness. … Today a similar deception is found among all professedly Christian churches.  
        <br>— Ellen G. White, <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, p. 309
      </div>

      <p>So, which God are you serving? Is it the holy, righteous God of the Bible—or a “god” molded after your own image?</p>

      <p>Our fruits will reveal whom we serve:</p>

      <div class="quote-bible">
        Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.  
        <br>— Matthew 7:20
      </div>
