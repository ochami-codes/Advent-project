    <h1>How To Handle a Heartbreak</h1>
  </div>

  <!-- Main Content -->
  <main>
    <p>In a world tainted with sin, heartbreaks from romantic relationships are common. If not handled well, they may lead to regrettable choices—emotional despair, bitterness, and even loss of faith. Yet, even in the darkest valley of disappointment, God offers healing, guidance, and hope.</p>

    <p>Heartbreak may sometimes be God’s way of teaching us that the path we were treading is not His perfect will. While pain, self-reproach, and discouragement may overwhelm us, God calls us to surrender our hearts to Him for renewal. So, how can we handle heartbreak in a way that draws us closer to Christ instead of driving us away?</p>

    <h2>1. Accept the Reality</h2>
    <p>The first step is to face the truth. Pretending nothing happened will not ease the pain. Science confirms that the brain processes emotional pain similarly to physical pain. Denial delays healing, but acceptance is the door to recovery.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.
      <span class="ref">Psalm 34:18</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="sop">The trials of life are God’s workmen to remove the impurities and roughness from our character. Their hewing, squaring, and chiseling, their burnishing and polishing, is a painful process; but it is through this that we are fitted for the heavenly building.
      <span class="ref">Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 10</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>2. Forgive</h2>
    <p>True healing cannot come without forgiveness. Bitterness only deepens the wound and closes the heart to God’s peace.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.
      <span class="ref">Mark 11:26</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Forgiveness is never easy. Our natural hearts resist it. But through Christ, forgiveness becomes possible. We forgive not because the offender deserves it, but because God forgave us first.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
      <span class="ref">Romans 10:10</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="sop">Do not think that because you have made mistakes you must always be under condemnation; for this is not necessary. Do not permit the enemy to lead you to think that because you have made mistakes, you must always remain under condemnation.
      <span class="ref">Steps to Christ, p. 57</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>3. Grow Through Personal Improvement</h2>
    <p>Heartbreak can be an opportunity for spiritual, emotional, and even practical growth. Instead of remaining stuck in despair, turn to God for transformation.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.
      <span class="ref">2 Corinthians 12:9</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="sop">It is the love of self that brings unrest. When we are born from above, the same mind will be in us that was in Jesus—the mind that led Him to humble Himself that we might be saved. Then we shall not be seeking the highest place. We shall desire to sit at the feet of Jesus, and learn of Him.
      <span class="ref">The Desire of Ages, p. 330</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>4. Wait on God’s Direction Concerning Relationships</h2>
    <p>Many heartbreaks arise because human feelings overrule divine guidance. God’s blueprint for courtship and marriage is often neglected, resulting in brokenness. But sometimes, a breakup is God’s protection—shielding us from future calamity.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
      <span class="ref">Proverbs 3:5–6</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="sop">Few have correct views of marriage. Many make a grave mistake in entering it. Satan is gratified to have the attention and affections of youth absorbed in each other, and that their time should be occupied in pleasing one another, instead of pleasing God.
      <span class="ref">Messages to Young People, p. 450</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Heartbreak does not mean you are unworthy or unloved. Rather, it can mean that God has something better prepared for you. In His love, He calls you to aim for higher standards instead of settling for less.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.
      <span class="ref">Jeremiah 29:11</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Remember, heartbreak is not the end. It can be the beginning of deeper intimacy with Christ, who alone satisfies the soul. Entrust your pain to Him, forgive as He forgives, and allow Him to mold you into His likeness.</p>

    <blockquote class="sop">Christ is the sympathetic, compassionate Redeemer. He has prepared His love, His pity, His grace, to meet the needs of the soul struggling for light. He will impart strength to sustain the soul that looks to Him in faith.
