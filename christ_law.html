        <h1>The Law and Jesus Christ</h1>

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p>Jesus Christ is the living expression of God's law. Many today think Jesus came to abolish the law, but His life and teachings reveal the opposite. Christ came to uphold the law, fulfill its purpose, and reveal its spiritual depth. Understanding the connection between Jesus and the law strengthens our faith and clarifies the nature of true righteousness.</p>

        <h2>Jesus is the Law Exemplified</h2>
        <p>In <strong>Matthew 5:17–18</strong>, Jesus declared,</p> <blockquote>“Think not that I am come to destroy the law... but to fulfil.”</blockquote> <p>To fulfill does not mean to abolish, it means to bring to full meaning and live it out perfectly. Jesus obeyed every commandment and taught the law’s spiritual intent, showing that sin begins in the heart.</p>

        <p><strong>Isaiah 42:21</strong> prophesied that Christ would</p>
        <blockquote>“magnify the law and make it honorable.”</blockquote> 
        <p>He revealed that the law is not just about outward actions, but inward purity. His sermon on the mount went beyond “do not kill” to include hatred, and beyond “do not commit adultery” to include lust. Christ’s life set a perfect example of obedience.</p>

        <p>Ellen G. White comments in <strong>Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, p. 49: </strong></p>
        <blockquote>“In His life Jesus of Nazareth gave a perfect example of obedience to the law of God.”</blockquote> 
        <p>The law was written in His heart, and His obedience was motivated by love and a desire to glorify His Father.</p>

        <p>Jesus did not only keep the law, He empowers us to keep it too. <strong>Romans 8:3–4</strong> explains that God sent His Son so that</p>
        <blockquote>“the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”</blockquote> 
        <p>Through faith in Christ, we receive grace to live in harmony with God’s will.</p>

        <h2>Christ Lived It, We Also Can Live It!</h2>
        <p>Christ’s relationship with the law is one of perfect unity. He lived it, taught it, magnified it, and now empowers His followers to keep it through grace. The law remains a reflection of God’s character, and Christ is the perfect picture of that character in action.</p>
