  <h2 style="color:#4CAF50;">Understanding God's Pharmacy</h2>

  <p>
    From the very beginning, God provided mankind with healing foods straight from nature. Before pharmaceutical labs and synthetic drugs, there was God’s own medicine cabinet, filled with fruits, herbs, seeds, and roots designed to nourish, cleanse, and restore the body. This concept, often called “God’s pharmacy,” is both a biblical and scientific approach to health, recognizing that our Creator has embedded powerful remedies within the foods He gave us.

    “And the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.” – Ezekiel 47:12
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    One of the best-known examples is the fig, which was used as a poultice for healing in the Bible. Modern science confirms that figs are rich in fiber, antioxidants, and minerals that support digestion and blood sugar regulation. Similarly, garlic and onions, which are widely mentioned in ancient diets, are now recognized for their potent antimicrobial and immune-boosting properties.

  <blockquote class="quote-sop">
    “God has provided antidotes for disease in simple plants, and these can be used by those who know their value.” – <em>Selected Messages</em>, Book 2, p. 288
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Scientific research supports what God has already revealed. For instance, garlic contains allicin, a natural compound shown to lower blood pressure and cholesterol. Turmeric, another biblical herb, contains curcumin, an anti-inflammatory compound praised for reducing pain and fighting chronic diseases.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="quote-sci">
    Studies have shown that garlic supplementation significantly reduces blood pressure in individuals with hypertension. – <em>Journal of Nutrition</em>, 2001
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Nature’s colors also hint at healing. Dark berries are packed with antioxidants for brain and heart health. Leafy greens detoxify the body. Even spices like cinnamon help balance blood sugar. These are not coincidences, they are intentional designs by the Creator, who cares for every aspect of our well-being.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="quote-bible">
    “He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man...” – Psalm 104:14
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Ellen White frequently encouraged the use of simple, natural foods for healing. She warned against relying solely on drugs when God’s methods are more effective and sustainable. The idea isn’t to reject modern medicine, but to prioritize God’s first remedies, those found in our gardens and kitchens.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="quote-sop">
    “There are many ways of practicing the healing art; but there is only one way that Heaven approves. God's remedies are the simple agencies of nature.” – <em>Ministry of Healing</em>, p. 127
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    As we learn to trust and use God’s pharmacy, we find healing not just for the body, but for the heart and soul. Every herb and fruit, every spice and seed, is a testimony of God’s love and wisdom. When we use them with gratitude and temperance, we draw closer to the One who made them.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="quote-bible">
    “O taste and see that the Lord is good.” – Psalm 34:8
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    God’s pharmacy is available to all, no prescriptions, no side effects, just simple, powerful gifts from nature. As you fill your plate with the colors of creation, remember that you are choosing health, healing, and holiness. It’s time to rediscover the original medicine God placed in our hands from the beginning.
