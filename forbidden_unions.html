    <h1>Can I Marry Someone I Don’t Share Faith With?</h1>
  </header>

  <main>

    <p>"He's kind. He's hardworking. He’s loving. I’ll preach to him after we’re married..." These are some of the common justifications many young believers give when they feel drawn to someone outside the faith. But feelings, no matter how powerful, are not the final authority for the Christian. God’s Word is. Marriage is not just about companionship; it’s a spiritual union, and when entered into carelessly, it can be a snare to the soul. The Bible and Spirit of Prophecy leave no ambiguity—venturing into marriage with someone who does not share your faith is stepping onto forbidden ground.</p>

    <h2>God’s Plain Instructions on Marriage</h2>

    <p>From the Old Testament to the New, God’s counsel concerning marriage between believers and unbelievers is clear and firm. Speaking to ancient Israel, the Lord commanded:</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      “Neither shalt thou make marriages with them... For they will turn away thy son from following Me, that they may serve other gods.”
      <span class="ref">— Deuteronomy 7:3–4</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This wasn’t a cultural or tribal restriction—it was spiritual. God’s concern was the eternal destiny of His people. He saw the danger of emotional ties that eclipse faithfulness to Him.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      “Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?”
      <span class="ref">— 2 Corinthians 6:14</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Paul's command is a divine safeguard. Love for God must come before emotional attachment to anyone else. The counsel is not meant to hurt us but to protect us from spiritual compromise and eternal loss.</p>

    <h2>The Testimony of Jesus Through Ellen White</h2>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      “There is in the Christian world an astonishing, alarming indifference to the teaching of God's word in regard to the marriage of Christians with unbelievers.”
      <span class="ref">— Adventist Home, p. 61.1</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Ellen White plainly states that <strong>“Marriage between believers and unbelievers is forbidden by God.”</strong> (AH 63.1). And she does not stop there. She shows how dangerous these alliances are:</p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      “To connect with an unbeliever is to place yourself on Satan's ground. You grieve the Spirit of God and forfeit His protection.”
      <span class="ref">— Adventist Home, p. 67.1</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This isn’t about rejecting kindness, love, or effort in others. It's about spiritual compatibility. A person may be moral, kind, and generous, but if they do not walk in the light of present truth, the spiritual goals and foundation of the marriage will not be united. The result?</p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      “They are lost to Christ... faith in the precious truth dies out of the heart, and Satan insidiously weaves about them a web of skepticism.”
      <span class="ref">— Adventist Home, p. 66.2</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Present Truth and the Real Definition of an Unbeliever</h2>

    <p>Many assume unbelievers are only outside the church. But Ellen White clarifies this dangerous misconception. An unbeliever can sit in church, quote scripture, and still be out of harmony with the truth.</p>

    <p>Anyone who rejects present truth, who resists reform, and who opposes God's last-day message—even subtly—is not a safe partner for a heaven-bound Christian. This includes lukewarm Adventists, those who make light of sacred things, or who downplay God’s standards.</p>

    <h2>God’s Ideal in Choosing a Life Partner</h2>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      “The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.”
      <span class="ref">— 1 Corinthians 7:39</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This is not a suggestion. It is divine command. No one who fears God should assume that they will change their partner after marriage. Evangelism must never be used as a bait to marry. In fact, Ellen White is stern about this:</p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      “Do not, I beg of you, lead others to believe that you can convert them after marriage.”
      <span class="ref">— Letter 8, 1895</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Instead, God calls us to wait upon Him, trust in His timing, and marry someone whose life is already in harmony with the gospel.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: So, Can You Marry Someone You Don't Share Faith With?</h2>

    <p>The plain answer, according to both <strong>Scripture</strong> and the <strong>Spirit of Prophecy</strong>, is <strong>no</strong>. It is <strong>forbidden</strong>. It is <strong>dangerous</strong>. And it is <strong>disobedient</strong> to God’s command.</p>

    <p>Love, kindness, and good intentions cannot override the principles of Heaven. To marry outside of your faith is to walk knowingly into a battlefield unarmed. The risk is not just to your happiness but to your salvation.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      “Can two walk together, except they be agreed?”
      <span class="ref">— Amos 3:3</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>True love will never ask you to compromise your walk with God. And if someone truly loves you, they will seek the God you love first.</p>

    <p><strong>So, wait for the one who walks in present truth. Wait for the one who hungers for righteousness. Wait for the one who helps you get to Heaven. Anything less is not worth the risk.</strong></p>
