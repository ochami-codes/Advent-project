    <h1>Dress and Simplicity</h1>

    <p>
      The way a Christian dresses is not a matter of fashion, but a reflection of the heart and values guided by heaven. God calls His people to dress modestly, simply, and in a way that honors Him, not the world. As the apostle Paul urged:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety… which becometh women professing godliness.”<br>
      <strong>—1 Timothy 2:9–10</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Ellen White taught that “dress is an index of the character,” showing who we serve, Christ or the world.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Dress is an index of the character.”<br>
      <em>—Messages to Young People, p. 344</em>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Modesty Reflects Reverence for God</h2>
    <p>
      Modesty is not just about covering the body; it is about honoring God through humility. Clothing that is tight, revealing, or overly extravagant draws attention to self rather than to the character of Christ. God desires His people to avoid “the pride of life” (1 John 2:16) and instead cultivate a spirit of meekness.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “A refined taste, a cultivated mind, will be revealed in the choice of simple and appropriate attire.”<br>
      <em>—Child Guidance, p. 414</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Modesty is part of worship—an outward expression of an inward commitment.
    </p>

    <h2>Simplicity Protects from Worldliness</h2>
    <p>
      Simplicity in dress helps protect the heart from pride, vanity, and competition. The pursuit of the latest styles or flashy trends leads to unnecessary spending and often breeds a spirit of worldliness. God’s call is clear:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Be not conformed to this world.”<br>
      <strong>—Romans 12:2</strong>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “Christians should not take pains to make themselves gazing stocks by dressing differently from the world’s fashion; but if, when they follow Christ’s teachings, their appearance is singular, they should not change their dress to meet the world's standard.”<br>
      <em>—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 1, p. 458</em>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Clothing as a Witness</h2>
    <p>
      A Christian’s appearance is a powerful silent witness. Before we speak, our dress communicates who we are and what we believe. Clean, modest, and orderly attire shows respect—for God, for others, and for ourselves. God told Israel:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.”<br>
      <strong>—Exodus 33:5</strong>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “True Christians will dress in plain, simple style, and their dress will bear testimony that they are children of God.”<br>
      <em>—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 1, p. 458</em>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Respecting Gender Distinctions</h2>
    <p>
      God created male and female distinct, and this distinction should be preserved in appearance.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment.”<br>
      <strong>—Deuteronomy 22:5</strong>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “God designed there should be a plain distinction between the dress of men and women.”<br>
      <em>—Child Guidance, p. 427</em>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Christian dress is not about legalism or shame; it is about representing Christ in every area of life. Simplicity, modesty, and gender distinction are not burdens but blessings, protecting our hearts and lifting our witness.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “The dress reform is not to be discarded. It is a part of the work which God has designed should attend the closing message.”<br>
      <em>—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 4, p. 634</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      When we dress to please God rather than man, we glorify Him in our body and spirit.
