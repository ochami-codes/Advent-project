    <h1>The Sabbath Commandment – A Forgotten Law</h1>

<!---Introduction-->
<p>The fourth commandment, calling us to remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy, is often neglected in modern Christianity. Yet it is a crucial part of God's moral law, rooted in creation and reaffirmed throughout Scripture. The Sabbath is a symbol of God’s authority and a sign between Him and His people.</p>

<!---Content-->
<h2>We are Called to Remember the Forgotten Law</h2>
<p><strong>Exodus 20:8–11</strong> calls us to remember the seventh day, the Sabbath, because God Himself rested after creation. The command begins with “Remember,” indicating God knew it would be forgotten. The Sabbath is a memorial of creation and a weekly call to worship the Creator.</p>

<p>In <strong>Mark 2:27–28</strong>, Jesus said,</p>
<blockquote>“The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.”</blockquote>
<p>It was not merely a Jewish ordinance but a divine gift for all humanity. Christ honored the Sabbath and healed on it, teaching its true purpose: mercy, rest, and worship.</p>

<p>Ellen G. White writes in The Great Controversy, p. 452:</p>
<blockquote>“The Sabbath is a test of loyalty… It is the point of truth especially controverted.”</blockquote> 
<p>In the end times, Sabbath observance will distinguish God’s faithful people, showing their allegiance to His law above human traditions.</p>

<p><strong>Isaiah 58:13–14</strong> promises a blessing for those who turn from their own pleasure on the Sabbath and call it a delight. Far from a burden, the Sabbath is a day for spiritual refreshing, family bonding, and communion with God. Its observance strengthens our walk with Christ.</p>


<!---Conclusion-->
<p>Though often forgotten or ignored, the Sabbath remains a sacred and binding commandment. It points us to God as Creator and Redeemer and prepares us for the test of loyalty in the last days. To honor the Sabbath is to honor the One who gave it.</p>
