        <h1>The Origin of Evil</h1>
        <section>
           <!--- <h2>Introduction</h2>-->
            <p>Deaths, famine, endless destructions, crime, and heart wrenching sights to behold, did God create these? Did He intend sufferings and woes to the poor inhabitants of the earth? What did God originally intend? What is the source of all this evil?</p>

            <h2>It was not His Plan!</h2>
            <p> Long before the earth was formed, before humanity ever knew sorrow or pain, there was harmony in all the universe. At the center of this peace was God—a being of love, justice, and order. But in this perfect realm, evil began where it was least expected: in the heart of one highly exalted angel Lucifer.</p>

               <p>Lucifer, meaning "light bearer," was not created evil. He was “perfect in [his] ways from the day [he was] created, till iniquity was found in [him]” <strong>(Ezekiel 28:15)</strong>. He was next to Christ in honor and had the privilege of serving in the very presence of God. But pride took root in his heart. He desired the throne of God:</p>
               <blockquote>“I will exalt my throne above the stars of God… I will be like the Most High” (Isaiah 14:13–14).</blockquote>

                 <p>Ellen White, in Patriarchs and Prophets, paints the picture clearly: </p>
                 <blockquote>“Little by little, Lucifer came to indulge the desire for self-exaltation… he was not content with his position, even though honored above the heavenly host.” (PP, p. 35)
                 </blockquote>

                  <p>Thus began the great controversy, a battle not of weapons but of loyalty. Lucifer's rebellion introduced sin, the mysterious principle of self-seeking, into God’s government. Heaven, once united, became divided. Ultimately, Lucifer and the angels who sided with him were cast out <strong>(Revelation 12:7–9)</strong>. Evil had been born, not as a creation of God, but as a perversion of His perfect order.</p>

            <h2>It is a Matter of Choice</h2>
            <p>God had power to stop evil from arising in His universe. He could have created robots, mere automatons that could have obeyed Him irregardless, but He did not do that. Why? He desired a service of love that stems from the heart as a result of knowing God's character. God is love and so He grants to each a right of choice, you can choose to obey Him or not. Dear one, will you accept Him?</p>
