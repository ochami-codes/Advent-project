    <h1>Can We Engage in Intimacy During Our Courtship?</h1>
  </div>

  <!-- Main Content -->
  <main>
    <p>
      Sex before marriage has become so common today that even raising the question seems unnecessary to many. 
      The world has normalized fornication to the point where what God calls sin is no longer seen as sinful, 
      even among those who claim to follow Him. But for God‚Äôs children, the issue of premarital sex is not about 
      culture, feelings, or convenience‚Äîit‚Äôs about faithfulness to the One we profess to serve.
    </p>

    <h2>The Problem of Premarital Sex</h2>
    <p>
      Engaging in premarital intimacy dishonors God in several ways. 
      It breaks His clear commandment to keep the marriage bed undefiled, 
      undermines the purity of the covenant relationship, 
      and opens the door for the enemy to take control of what should be a holy preparation for marriage.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.
      <span class="ref">‚Äî Hebrews 13:4</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Courtship and Spiritual Danger</h2>
    <p>
      Many courtships today are carried on in a way that excludes God, while giving the devil influence 
      over relationships that should belong to Christ. A courtship not founded on prayer, purity, and respect 
      will not produce a marriage blessed by God.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="sop">
      Courtship as carried on in this age is a scheme of deception and hypocrisy, with which the enemy of souls 
      has far more to do than the Lord.
      <span class="ref">‚Äî Adventist Home, p. 55.3</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      If the devil is given control of our courtship, who then will dominate the marriage? 
      The answer is clear: unless God is invited into our courtship, He will not be the foundation of our marriage. 
      And a marriage built on lust, secrecy, or sin cannot enjoy God‚Äôs blessing.
    </p>

    <h2>True Love Waits</h2>
    <p>
      Courtship is not the place for physical indulgence but for spiritual preparation, mutual respect, 
      and seeking God‚Äôs will together. A couple who honors God before marriage will invite His presence and blessing 
      after marriage. But those who compromise in courtship will reap sorrow later.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? 
      You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. 
      So glorify God in your body.
      <span class="ref">‚Äî 1 Corinthians 6:19‚Äì20</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Purity is not just about avoiding sin; it is about glorifying God with our bodies and preserving 
      the sacred gift of intimacy for its rightful place‚Äîwithin the holy covenant of marriage. 
      When we honor God in our courtship, we secure His blessing for our future home.
