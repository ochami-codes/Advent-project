  <h1>“It Is Too Late!” – The Tragic End of Judas Iscariot</h1>
</header>

<main>

  <p>A maddened figure stumbles upon a blood-chilling scene—beneath a lifeless tree lies a mangled body, torn by scavenging dogs. Above it, a cord swings loosely from a broken branch, the grim reminder of a soul weighed down by guilt and despair. A crowd gathers, stunned. Whispers rise as they contemplate the unthinkable: <strong>Who could have ended their life so cruelly?</strong> As they stare at the broken form, their hearts are pierced with the haunting reality of one who betrayed innocent blood.</p>

  <p>The history of Judas Iscariot presents the sorrowful conclusion of a life that could have been greatly honored by God. Had Judas died before his final journey to Jerusalem, he would have been remembered as a noble disciple, one worthy of a place among the Twelve. His name would have evoked admiration rather than horror.</p>

  <blockquote>“But it was for a purpose that his character was laid open to the world. It was to be a warning to all who, like him, should betray sacred trusts.” – <strong>Desire of Ages, p. 716.1</strong></blockquote>

  <h2>A Privileged Position Misused</h2>

  <p>Judas walked closely with Christ. He witnessed the Savior’s miracles, received His gentle teachings, and was entrusted as the treasurer of the little church. He preached the gospel and cast out demons. So why did his life end in such despair?</p>

  <blockquote>“But Judas did not come to the point of surrendering himself fully to Christ... he cultivated a disposition to criticize and accuse.” – <strong>DA 716.4</strong></blockquote>

  <h2>The Slow Drift Toward Betrayal</h2>

  <p>As treasurer, Judas was entrusted with funds meant for the disciples and the poor. This position could have developed in him a spirit of unselfish service. But Judas indulged in covetousness. He repeatedly helped himself to the money bag, justifying it with flimsy excuses. In his eyes, these actions seemed reasonable—but in God's sight, <strong>he was a thief</strong>.</p>

  <blockquote>“Often when he did a little service for Christ... he paid himself out of this meager fund.” – <strong>DA 717.2</strong></blockquote>

  <p>Yet even then, he was not beyond redemption. Judas was not fully hardened. After secretly pledging twice to betray Jesus, he still had opportunities to repent. At the Passover supper, Jesus lovingly appealed to him, even washing his feet. But Judas ignored the final appeal of divine love. And when he left the upper room that night, <strong>he sealed his fate</strong>.</p>

  <h2>The Final Hour of Darkness</h2>

  <p>Judas did not think Christ would actually be condemned. He thought his betrayal would force Jesus to assert His power. But as Jesus submitted to arrest and trial, Judas realized with horror that he had delivered the Son of God to death.</p>

  <blockquote>“He is innocent; spare Him, O Caiaphas!” – <strong>DA 721.4</strong></blockquote>

  <p>In despair, Judas fell at Jesus’ feet, pleading for deliverance. But his confession was not born of repentance—it was a reaction to guilt and fear of judgment. His heart remained unchanged. Jesus, ever merciful, spoke no word of reproach. He simply said, <strong>“For this hour came I into the world.”</strong></p>

  <blockquote>“He felt that he could not live to see Jesus crucified, and in despair went out and hanged himself.” – <strong>DA 722.4</strong></blockquote>

  <h2>A Solemn Warning to Us All</h2>

  <p>The story of Judas is not merely historical—it is deeply personal. His fall did not happen in a moment. It began with small compromises, unchecked ambitions, and a refusal to surrender fully to Christ. Even proximity to Jesus, active ministry, and spiritual gifts could not save him without true heart conversion.</p>

  <p>Let this be a sober reminder: <strong>It is not enough to walk with Jesus outwardly; we must surrender fully inwardly.</strong> May we heed the lessons of his life and avoid the path that ends in despair.</p>
