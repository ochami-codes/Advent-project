      <p>Have you ever come across this verse?</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        “And He said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.”<br><b>– Mark 16:15</b>
      </blockquote>

      <p>How seriously do you take it?</p>

      <p>If you think it’s not serious, then consider this:</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        “When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning… the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.”<br><b>– Ezekiel 3:18</b>
      </blockquote>

      <p>So God will require the blood of the unwarned wicked at your hand?</p>
      <p>In other words—you’re a <strong>murderer</strong> if you fail to warn them.</p>

      <p>What if you do warn them, and they still refuse to change?</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        “Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness… he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.”<br><b>– Ezekiel 3:19</b>
      </blockquote>

      <p>You see? It’s a matter of <strong>life and death.</strong></p>

      <p>God has made you a watchman. You are tasked with warning those around you about the coming judgment.</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        “Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at My mouth, and give them warning from Me.”<br><b>– Ezekiel 3:17</b>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Isn’t it an honor to serve the Sovereign of the universe?</p>

      <p>It’s true—not everyone who hears the gospel will repent. Should that bother you?</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-bible">
        “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.”<br><b>– Matthew 24:14</b>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The gospel is preached as a witness, even if it's rejected, so the wicked will be without excuse.</p>

      <p>When God asks you, <strong>“Where is your brother?”</strong> will you have an answer?</p>

      <p>Will you answer rudely like Cain, <strong>“I know not: Am I my brother’s keeper?”</strong></p>

      <p>Dear one, the eternity of your friend, your neighbor, your sister, your mother, your brother, your father—may lie in your hands.</p>

      <p>There is certainly something <em>you</em> can do in the Lord’s vineyard.</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-sop">
        “Service to God includes personal ministry. By personal effort we are to co-operate with Him for the saving of the world... All who are ordained unto the life of Christ are ordained to work for the salvation of their fellow men. Their hearts will throb in unison with the heart of Christ. The same longing for souls that He has felt will be manifest in them. Not all can fill the same place in the work, but there is a place and a work for all.”<br><b>– Christ’s Object Lessons, pp. 300–301</b>
      </blockquote>

      <p><strong>Don't delay. Be your brother’s keeper. Preach the gospel. Save a soul.</strong></p>
