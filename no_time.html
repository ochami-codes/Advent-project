<h2>📜 The Danger of Delay: When ‘Later’ Becomes Never</h2>

Theme Text:

<blockquote class="quote-bible">“Today, if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts.”
—Hebrews 3:15</blockquote>

 <h3>Introduction: The Subtle Trap</h3>

<p>Satan rarely tempts us to deny God outright. Instead, he whispers, “Just not today.” Many souls have been lost, not because they rejected the truth, but because they postponed surrender. Procrastination in spiritual matters is one of the enemy’s most successful snares. When we say “later” to victory over known sin, we step onto dangerous ground.</p>

<h3>1️⃣ Sin Grows Stronger With Delay</h3>

<p>Sin doesn’t sit still. It strengthens, settles in, and begins to shape our thoughts, habits, and character. What we once saw as wrong may start to feel “normal.” That small indulgence becomes a chain.</p>

<blockquote class="quote-bible">“His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.”
—Proverbs 5:22</blockquote>



<p>Ellen White warns:</p>

<blockquote class="quote-sop"> “Every act of transgression...is reacting upon yourself... it is sowing seed which will bring forth a harvest of death.”
—Steps to Christ, p. 33</blockquote>

<h3>2️⃣ The Holy Spirit’s Voice Grows Fainter</h3>

<p>God's Spirit speaks gently, but powerfully. Yet if we delay obedience, the voice becomes easier to ignore. Each time we resist conviction, we risk grieving the Spirit away.</p>

<blockquote class="quote-bible"> “My Spirit shall not always strive with man.”
—Genesis 6:3</blockquote>



<blockquote class="quote-sop"> “It is unsafe to delay obedience. You may never hear the invitation again.”
—Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 281</blockquote>

<h3>3️⃣ The Heart Becomes Hardened</h3>

<p>Pharaoh delayed repentance until his heart became like stone. Judas postponed surrender until he could no longer repent. When sin is cherished, the heart grows cold to Christ.</p>

<blockquote class="quote-bible"> “He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.”
—Proverbs 29:1</blockquote>



<p>God doesn’t turn away the repentant, but the unrepentant may lose the desire and ability to turn at all.</p>


---

<h3>4️⃣ Delaying is Choosing Against Christ</h3>

<p>There is no neutral ground. To delay is to say: <em>“This sin is more important than Jesus, for now.”</em> But time is not ours. Every delay is a risk of eternal consequence.</p>

<blockquote class="quote-bible"> “To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.”
—James 4:17</blockquote>




---

<h3>5️⃣ Grace Is Available Now</h3>

<p>The good news is, we don’t need to conquer sin by sheer willpower. Jesus stands ready to forgive and empower. He gives grace to overcome when we surrender fully now.</p>

<blockquote class="quote-bible"> “Now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.”
—2 Corinthians 6:2</blockquote>




---

<h3>Conclusion: Choose Christ Today</h3>

<p>Don’t wait. Don’t reason. Don’t bargain. Come to Christ just as you are, and surrender that sin completely. Tomorrow is not promised, but victory is available today.</p>

<blockquote class="quote-bible"> “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock...”
—Revelation 3:20</blockquote>



<p>Jesus is knocking. Will you open now?</p>
