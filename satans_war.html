      <h2>5. Why Satan Fights So Fiercely?</h2>
    <p>
      Broken families, bitter spouses, adultery, and heart-wrenching separations all point to a mighty foe that relentlessly wars against marriage. After the Sabbath, marriage is one of the institutions that has faced the fiercest attacks from Satan.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through the agencies he controls, the devil has laid intricate plans to eliminate the family unit. Think of it: the introduction of gay marriages, hormonal birth control and vasectomy, the redefinition of gender roles, and the normalization of casual divorce—all designed to make marriage seem like a bitter pill. These dark agendas, often disguised as "progress," undermine the multiplication of a godly seed and the sanctity of the marriage covenant.

      “What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.”<br/>
      — <strong>Mark 10:9</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Why such a fiery war? It's simple—Satan is jealous. He knows that redeemed humanity will take the place he lost in heaven (Revelation 3:21). He wars against marriage because it reflects the image of God, and by destroying it, he hopes to hurt the Author of marriage Himself. Families are meant to reflect heaven; when they are broken, it brings dishonor to God.

    <blockquote class="sop">
      “Satan is constantly at work with intense energy and under a thousand disguises to misrepresent and malign the character and government of God. With unwearied vigilance and cunning he seeks to gain control of the minds of men.”<br/>
      — <strong>Great Controversy, p. 500</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The war is real, and the earlier we realize it, the better. To every standing Christian marriage, Satan has rallied a host of demons to ensure its failure. But praise God—what He protects, nothing can bring down.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bible">
      “The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.”<br/>
      — <strong>Psalm 34:7</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Let us commit our homes to the Lord, watch and pray, and live as witnesses that God's plan for marriage still stands strong in a collapsing world.
