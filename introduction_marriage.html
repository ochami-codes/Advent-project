      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In today’s world, even among Seventh-day Adventists, <strong>marriage is under pressure</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to church-based research and global trends:
        <br><br>
        Out of every 10 new Adventist marriages, about 2 eventually end in divorce.
        <br>
        That means roughly <strong>1 in 5 Adventist marriages fails</strong>—sometimes even more depending on region, age, or spiritual involvement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Something seems off, right? Have we, the children of God, also joined the world in destroying the very institution the Lord loves?
        Marriage is no longer seen primarily for companionship or spiritual growth, but has become a business opportunity, a place to escape from suffering, or a stage to foster selfish ambition.
      </p>

      <p>
        We must search the book of the Lord and discover where we've left the <em>old and ancient paths</em>!
        As we will discover later, <strong>God has invested a lot in marriage and it has to succeed!</strong>
      </p>

      <blockquote class="bible">
        “Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls.” 
        <span class="ref">— Jeremiah 6:16</span>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="sop">
        “Marriage is something that will influence and affect your life both in this world and in the world to come. A sincere Christian will make no plans that God cannot approve.” 
        <span class="ref">— Adventist Home, p. 70</span>
