  <article>
    <p class="lead-line">Through the transparent, glistening walls of the New Jerusalem, Sister Miriam stands still. Her face, radiant with the glory of immortality, is suddenly shadowed by sorrow.</p>

    <p>Beyond the golden walls she sees what her heart most dreads—a vast, chaotic throng led by Satan himself, pressing forward to capture the beloved city of God. And among the countless faces, one pierces her soul—Daniel, her only son.</p>

    <p>Miriam had just finished the thousand-year period in heaven, the millennial judgment (<em>Revelation 20:4</em>). During those years, she and the saints reviewed the records of the lost. When she first entered heaven on that glorious day, she had looked for Daniel among the resurrected righteous. But he was not there. As she received her crown from the lovely Jesus (<em>2 Timothy 4:8</em>), questions burned within her soul. Yet she knew that Christ would give every answer in His own time.</p>

    <p>In the courts of heaven, the books were opened (<em>Daniel 7:10; Revelation 20:12</em>). The entire universe looked on as case after case was examined. Then came Daniel’s record. Born into an Adventist home, taught to love and obey God, he once chose baptism. Miriam and her husband prayed fervently, teaching him the narrow way. But when Miriam passed away, Daniel’s heart drifted. Christianity seemed too narrow, too restraining. Though the Spirit pleaded, he hardened his heart and turned away. Finally, he died outside of Christ—destined for the resurrection of the unjust (<em>John 5:29</em>).</p>

    <blockquote class="spirit">"Every question of truth and error in the long-standing controversy has now been made plain. The results of rebellion, the fruits of setting aside the divine statutes, have been laid open to the view of all created intelligences." — <cite>Great Controversy, p. 670</cite></blockquote>

    <p>As the records were unsealed, Miriam’s tears flowed, but her heart confessed, “True and righteous are Thy ways, O King of saints” (<em>Revelation 15:3</em>). She understood. The universe understood. God’s justice and mercy stood vindicated.</p>

    <p>Now the thousand years are ended. The city rests on the valley formed when Christ’s feet touch the Mount of Olives (<em>Zechariah 14:4</em>). The wicked dead are raised. Satan rallies them with false hope, pointing to the shining city. With military ranks and endless multitudes, they surge forward. And Miriam, standing inside the city, beholds Daniel—alive again, yet lost forever. Their eyes meet across the gulf of separation. For one solemn moment, mother and son lock gazes.</p>

    <p>The scene shifts. A great white throne appears (<em>Revelation 20:11</em>). Christ the Judge sits upon it, surrounded by the redeemed. The lost are confronted with the records of their lives. Every secret sin is revealed. Excuses vanish. Leaders who misled souls cry in anguish. Satan himself trembles, powerless before the majesty of Christ. Daniel’s face changes as realization dawns—he has rejected eternal life. He turns, blaming his companions, but it is too late.</p>

    <p>Darkness thickens. The fire of God descends (<em>Revelation 20:9</em>). Earth becomes a vast, blazing furnace (<em>Malachi 4:1</em>). Miriam watches through tears as Daniel, along with the vast multitude, perishes in the flames. She remembers the words: “It is an act of love to the universe when God destroys sin and sinners” (<em>Great Controversy, p. 543</em>). Pain sears her immortal heart, but she knows—this is the final victory of justice and love.</p>

    <p>Then silence falls. The flames die away. The earth, once cursed and ruined, is purified by fire. Christ speaks: “Behold, I make all things new” (<em>Revelation 21:5</em>). The saints weep no more; every tear is wiped away (<em>Revelation 21:4</em>). Sorrow, death, and pain are forever gone. The redeemed lift their voices in praise as the universe beholds the dazzling renewal of the earth.</p>

    <blockquote class="bible">"Here, when the work of redemption is accomplished, God’s original purpose in the creation of the earth is fulfilled... From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, the name of the Lord shall be one." — <cite>Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 342</cite></blockquote>

    <p>The New Jerusalem shines in glory, and the throne of God is established on this very world. That which was once darkened by sin now becomes the center of the universe. Miriam raises her eyes to the throne of the Lamb. Eternity stretches before her. Joy fills her soul—though Daniel chose not to be there, she will forever dwell with Jesus, who loved her and gave Himself for her.</p>

    <p class="lead-line">Friend, will you be there? Will you stand inside the city, rejoicing in Christ’s salvation, or outside the walls, facing eternal loss? Now is the day of salvation. Choose Christ, and eternity with Him, today.</p>
